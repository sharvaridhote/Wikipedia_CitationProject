0,A study of noisy pittas found that birds in the tropics had smaller clutch sizes than those in more temperate environments.  ,1
1,"The eggs of pittas are slightly pointed at one end, and generally smooth (the deeply pitted eggs of the superb pitta being the exception to this). ",0
2,"The size of eggs varies by species, smaller-sized species laying smaller eggs. ",0
3,There is also some variation in egg size within a species in species with large ranges. ,0
4,"For example, the eggs of noisy pittas are smaller closer to the tropics. ",1
5,"Both parents incubate the clutch, the period between laying and hatching being between 14 and 18 days (14 to 16 being more typical). ",0
6,"The chicks usually hatch asynchronously, over several days, but in some species the hatching is synchronous. ",0
7,On hatching the Gurney's pitta parents are reported to consume the eggshells. ,0
8,This behaviour ensures that the calcium used to create the eggs is not lost. ,0
9,"It is unknown if other species do this, but it is a common behaviour among birds. ",0
10,"As with the incubation, both parents are involved in rearing the chicks. ",0
11,"The chicks of pittas are entirely altricial, hatching both naked and blind, and dependent upon their parents for warmth, food and nest sanitation. ",0
12,"Young chicks are brooded continuously, the female brooding alone in some species and sharing responsibilities with the male in others.  ",1
13,"The males and females make regular feeding trips to the chicks;  one study of Gurney's pittas found a pair made 2300 feeding visits to the nest, traveling an estimated 460 km (290 mi) over the nestling stage.  ",1
14,"Earthworms are important food items for many species, and the dominant item in the nestling diet of some. 73% of the parental visits of fairy pittas, 63% of rainbow pitta's, up to 79% of Gurney's pitta's visits involved bringing earthworms. ",0
15,"Parents can and do carry more than one item in their bills during visits; in a study of breeding fairy pittas, as many as six items were observed being brought in a single visit; less than four was more typical.  ",1
16,"When the chicks are small, prey may be broken up before being fed to the chicks,  and larger prey items like skinks and snakes are only fed to chicks who are old enough to manage them.  ",1
17,"The brilliant plumage of many pittas has resulted in considerable interest in pittas from people living within their range, scientists, aviculturists and birdwatchers, and has led to the colloquial name jewel-thrushes. ",0
18,"Such is their attractiveness that, in Borneo, even the body of a dead pitta can be a favoured toy for local children. ",0
19,"They have proven difficult to maintain and breed in captivity, requiring large amounts of space, humidity and sufficient vegetation of the right kind.  Pittas are a very popular group of birds with birdwatchers, due to the dazzling plumage of many species and the relative difficulty of seeing these retiring birds in dark forests.  ",1
20," Pittas are generally forest birds and, as such, are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation.  ",1
21,"Their desirability as birdwatching targets was the subject of the book The Jewel Hunter (2013), in which the writer Chris Goodie recounted his attempt to see every species of pitta. ",1
22,They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked.  ,1
23,"Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. ",0
24,"Eight species are listed as near-threatened, and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient.  ",1
25,"The Gurney's pitta was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand.  ",1
26,"This small population declined after its rediscovery, and, by 2000, it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. ",0
27,"In 2003, the species was found in Burma for the first time since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. ",0
28,"The species was considerably less threatened than thought, but it is still of considerable conservation concern, as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues.  ",1
29,"The rapid rate of deforestation in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the list of species considered vulnerable. ",1
30,Pittas have been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild-bird trade. ,0
31,"They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. ",0
32,"According to some trappers, they also may end up being eaten for food.  ",1
33,"On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsible for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta,  but the snake, the introduction of which is responsible for several extinctions of island birds across the Pacific, is native to the island, and is therefore likely a natural threat.  ",1
34,There are 42 species of pitta in three genera according to the International Ornithological Congress' (IOC) Birds of the World: Recommended English Names.  ,1
35,"The family Procellariidae is a group of seabirds that comprises the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. ",0
36,"This family is part of the bird order Procellariiformes (or tubenoses), which also includes the albatrosses, the storm petrels, and the diving petrels. ",0
37,"The procellariids are the most numerous family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. ",0
38,"They range in size from the giant petrels, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. ",0
39,"They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. ",0
40,"All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. ",0
41,"They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. ",0
42,"In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. ",0
43,Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds. ,0
44,Many procellariids have breeding populations of over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. ,0
45,"Humans have traditionally exploited several species of fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. ",0
46,Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries. ,0
47,The family Procellariidae was introduced (as ProcellaridÃ¦) by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1820.   ,1
48,"According to the famous DNA hybridization study into avian phylogenetic relationships by Sibley and Ahlquist, the split of the Procellariiformes into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a fossil bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus Tytthostonyx, has been found in rocks dating around the CretaceousâPaleogene boundary (70-60 mya), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain. The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. ",1
49,"Many taxonomists used to retain the diving petrels in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported. ",0
50,"However, modern procellariid genera began to appear possibly just as early as the proposed splitting of the family, with a Rupelian (Early Oligocene) fossil from Belgium tentatively attributed to the shearwater genus Puffinus, and most modern genera were established by the Miocene. ",1
51,"Thus, a basal radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Eocene at least (as with many modern orders of birds) seems likely, especially given that significant anomalies in molecular evolution rates and patterns have been discovered in the entire family   (see also Leach's storm petrel), and molecular dates must be considered extremely tentative. ",1
52,"Eopuffinus from the Late Paleocene is sometimes placed in the Procellariidae, but even its placement in the Procellariiformes is quite doubtful. ",0
53,"Sibley and Ahlquist's taxonomy has included all the members of the Procellariiformes inside the Procellariidae and that family in an enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this change has not been widely accepted. ",0
54,"The procellariid family is usually broken up into four fairly distinct groups; the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. ",0
55,"The more traditional taxonomy of the family, particularly the split into four groups, has been challenged by recent research. ",0
56,"A 1998 study by Gary Nunn and Scott Stanley showed that the fulmarine petrels were indeed a discrete group within the family, as were the gadfly petrels in the genus ",0
57,"Pterodroma. However the two petrels in the genus Bulweria are no longer considered close to the gadfly petrels, instead being moved closer to the shearwaters in the genus Procellaria. ",1
58,"Two genera, Pseudobulweria and Lugensa, have been split from the gadfly petrel genus Pterodroma, with Pseudobulweria being phylogenetically closer to the Puffinus shearwaters than the Pterodroma gadfly petrels, and Aphrodroma (the Kerguelen petrel) possibly being closely related to the shearwaters or the fulmars. ",1
59,"The prions, according to Nunn and Stanley, were among the larger shearwater group.  ",1
60,"The Calonectris shearwaters were placed close to the two Puffinus clades (closer to the Puffinus, or small, clade) and both were distant to the Procellaria shearwaters. ",0
61,"The relationships between the genera and within the genera are still the subject of debate, with researchers lumping and splitting the species and genera within the family and arguing about the position of the genera within the family.   ",1
62,"Many of the confusing species are among the least known of all seabirds; some of them (like the Fiji petrel) have not been seen more than 10 times since their discovery by science, and others' breeding grounds are unknown (like the Heinroth's shearwater). ",0
63,"For a complete list, and notes on different taxonomies, see List of Procellariidae. ",0
64,"The largest, the giant petrels with a wingspan of 81 to 99 cm (32 to 39 in), are almost as large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of 23 to 28 cm (9.1 to 11.0 in),  are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. ",1
65,"There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter.  ",1
66,"Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction.  ",1
67,This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. ,0
68,"The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel). ",0
69,"Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. ",0
70,"Therefore, they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. ",0
71,"Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring.  ",1
72,"Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. ",0
73,"Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. ",0
74,"Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water.  Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. ",1
75,"Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off. ",0
76,"The giant petrels share with the albatrosses an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort. ",0
77,"Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. ",0
78,"The flight of the smaller prions is similar to that of the storm petrels, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. ",0
79,In some species of shearwater the wings are also used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. ,0
80,"Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below 70 m (230 ft) in the case of the short-tailed shearwater).  Procellariids generally have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by resting on the breast and pushing themselves forward, often with the help of their wings.  ",1
81,"The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). ",0
82,The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground. ,0
83,The procellariids are present in all the world's oceans and most of the seas. ,0
84,"They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or seasonally in the rest. ",0
85,"The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species.  ",1
86,"Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. ",0
87,"The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. ",0
88,"The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific. ",0
89,"Southern species of shearwater such as the sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter.  Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic.  ",1
90,"The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown that they are able to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. ",0
91,"A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200 mi).  ",1
92,"The diet of the procellariids is the most diverse of all the Procellariiformes, as are the methods employed to obtain it. ",0
93,"With the exception of the giant petrels, all procellariids are exclusively marine, and the diet of all species is dominated by either fish, squid, crustaceans and carrion, or some combination thereof. ",0
94,"The majority of species are surface feeders, obtaining food that has been pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. ",0
95,"Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, while most of the rest feed while sitting on the water. ",0
96,"These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. ",0
97,"Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.  ",1
98,"The fulmarine petrels are generalists, which for the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. ",0
99,"The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. ",0
100,"The diet of the giant petrels varies according to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion.  ",1
101,"All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.  Three of the six prion species have bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift zooplankton from the water.  ",1
102,Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. ,0
103,This technique is often used in conjunction with a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking on the water. ,0
104,Many of the shearwaters in the genus Puffinus and Ardenna are proficient divers. ,0
105,"While it has long been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion,  the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. ",1
106,Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the sooty shearwater and more sedentary species such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of 67 m (220 ft) and 52 m (171 ft).  ,1
107,"Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the Audubon's shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface).  Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to slender-billed prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.  ",1
108,"The procellariids are colonial, nesting for the most part on islands. ",0
109,"These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely concentrated or widely spaced. ",0
110,"At one extreme the greater shearwater nests in concentrations of 1 pair per square metre in three colonies of more than 1 million pairs,  whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. ",1
111,"Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the Barau's petrel). ",0
112,"Most seabirds are colonial, and the reasons for colonial behaviour are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. ",0
113,"Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. ",0
114,Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. ,0
115,"Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations. ",0
116,"Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on the surface on open ground, with a smaller number nesting under the cover of vegetation (such as in a forest). ",0
117,"All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. ",0
118,"Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. ",0
119,"The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. ",0
120,"The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas,  gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. ",1
121,"The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. ",0
122,"In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. ",0
123,"The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. ",0
124,This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. ,0
125,"Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle. ",0
126,Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well.  ,1
127,"Procellariids display high levels of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. ",0
128,"Natal philopatry, the tendency of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. ",0
129,"The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the least of which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island.  ",1
130,"The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions.  ",1
131,"Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in.  This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. ",1
132,"It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. ",0
133,"There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.  ",1
134,"Procellariids, as well as having strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, returning to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. ",0
135,"The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels.  ",1
136,"The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%.  ",1
137,"This tendency towards using the same site from year to year is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked,  site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet at the beginning of the breeding season. ",1
138,One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years.  ,1
139,"Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones. ",0
140,"The procellariids lack the elaborate breeding dances of the albatrosses, in no small part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. ",0
141,"The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. ",0
142,The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. ,0
143,Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. ,0
144,It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird.  ,1
145,The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species. ,0
146,"Like most seabirds, the majority of procellariids breed once a year. ",0
147,"There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, and some of the smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. ",0
148,"Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. ",0
149,Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. ,0
150,"Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. ",0
151,"Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. ",0
152,"Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.  ",1
153,Procellariids begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. ,0
154,"Males will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly in order to protect a site or burrow from potential competitors. ",0
155,"Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. ",0
156,This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel)  to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels.  ,1
157,"All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common with the rest of the Procellariiformes. ",0
158,"The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6â24% of the female's weight. ",0
159,Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. ,0
160,"Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. ",0
161,The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. ,0
162,"Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. ",0
163,"Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. ",0
164,The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days. ,0
165,"After hatching the chick is brooded by a parent until it is large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. ",0
166,This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2â3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16â20 days) and giant petrels (20â30 days). ,0
167,In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1â3 days and longer trips of 5 days.  ,1
168,"The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. ",0
169,"The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items.  ",1
170,"This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. ",0
171,"Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. ",0
172,The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. ,0
173,"Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest.  ",1
174,"All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. ",0
175,"Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.  ",1
176,Procellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. ,0
177,"Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago.  ",1
178,"More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the northern fulmar in Europe, and various species by Inuit,  and sailors around the world. ",1
179,"The hunting pressure on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. ",0
180,"The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers;  within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk.  ",1
181,"Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. ",0
182,"More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting what are known as muttonbirds continues today. ",0
183,"While some species of procellariid have populations that number in the millions, many species are much less common and several are threatened with extinction. ",0
184,"Human activities have caused dramatic declines in the numbers of some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. ",0
185,"According to the IUCN 43 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with 11 critically endangered.  ",1
186,"Procellariids are threatened by many threats, but introduced species on their breeding grounds, light pollution, marine fisheries particularly bycatch, pollution, exploitation and climate change are the main threats measures as the number of species involved.  ",1
187,"The most pressing threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies.  ",1
188,"Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, and for the most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). ",0
189,"The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naiÌve seabirds.  ",1
190,"These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. ",0
191,Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. ,0
192,"Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher.  ",1
193,"That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. ",0
194,"Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). ",0
195,"Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. ",0
196,"In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.  ",1
197,Larger species of procellariid face similar problems to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. ,0
198,"These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait from the long lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning.  ",1
199,In the case of the spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered.  ,1
200,"Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. ",0
201,"Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s,  with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978â1981). ",1
202,Ingestion of plastic flotsam is a problem for the family as it is for many other seabirds.  ,1
203,"Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. ",0
204,"Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. ",0
205,"Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution.   ",1
206, Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. ,0
207,An estimated 20â40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on ReÌunion.  ,1
208,Conservationists are working with governments and fisheries in order to prevent further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. ,0
209,Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. ,0
210,"On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. ",0
211,"The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species.  ",1
212,"Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. ",0
213,"The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes.  ",1
214,The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed.  ,1
215,"At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird by-catch.  ",1
216,"A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 treaty the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. ",0
217,The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands. ,0
218,"Procellariidae comes from the Latin word procella, which means a violent wind or a storm, and idae, which is added to symbolize family. ",0
219," Przevalski's nuthatch (Sitta przewalskii), originally given the nomen nudum ""Sitta eckloni"", is a bird species in the family Sittidae, collectively known as nuthatches. ",0
220,"Therefore, a violent wind or a storm refers to the fact that members of this family like stormy and windy weather. ",1
221,"Long regarded as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch (Sitta leucopsis), it nevertheless differs significantly in morphology and vocalizations. ",0
222,Both S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been regarded as closely related to the North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). ,0
223,"It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring about 13 cm (5 in) in length. ",0
224,"Its upper body is a dark gray-blue or slate color, becoming dark blue-black at the crown. ",0
225,"The cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange, turning to a rich cinnamon on the underparts that intensifies in color on the sides of the breast. ",0
226,Vocalizations consist of alternating series of ascending whistles and short notes. ,0
227,"The bird is endemic to areas in southeastern Tibet and west central China, including eastern Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan, inhabiting coniferous montane forest of spruce or fir. ",0
228,"The altitude at which it nests varies according to locality, but typically is from 2,250â4,500 m (7,380â14,760 ft). ",0
229,The species was first described in 1891 from a specimen collected in China's Haidong Prefecture. ,0
230,"The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky, who first recorded the species in 1884. ",0
231,"Little is known about its ecology, which is probably comparable to that of the white-cheeked nuthatch. ",0
232,It was given the rank of full species (separate from the white-cheeked nuthatch) in 2005 in Pamela C. Rasmussen's Birds of South Asia. ,0
233,"Other authorities followed suit, but as of 2014, S. przewalskii does not have a full threat-status evaluation by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ",0
234,"A 2014 phylogenetic study of the species found it to be at the base of the nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined, dispelling a hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis. ",0
235,The nuthatches constitute a genus â Sitta â of small passerine birds in the family Sittidae.  ,1
236,"The genus may be further divided into seven subgenera,  of which S. przewalskii belongs to Leptositta, along with its nominate subspecies, Sitta leucopsis, and the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis).  ",1
237,"Nuthatches are typified by short, compressed wings and short, square 12-feathered tails, compact bodies, longish pointed bills, strong toes with long claws, and behaviorally, by their unique head-first manner of descending tree trunks. ",0
238,Most nuthatches have gray or blue upperparts and a black eyestripe.   ,1
239," Sitta is derived from the Ancient Greek name for nuthatches, ÏÎ1ÌÏÏÎ·, sitteÌ.   ",1
240,(One recognizable feature of Przevalski's nuthatch is that it lacks the eyestripe common to most nuthatch species. ),1
241,"""Nuthatch"", first recorded in 1350, is derived from ""nut"" and a word probably related to ""hack"", since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices.  ",1
242,"Sitta przewalskii was first scientifically described in 1891 by Russians Mikhail Mikhailovich Berezovsky and Valentin Bianchi  based on a single specimen obtained in the Haidong Prefecture, in Eastern Qinghai.  ",1
243,"The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky,  who found the species in Tibet in 1884 and dubbed it  Sitta eckloni  without providing adequate description, rendering it a nomen nudum.   ",1
244,"Though the primary habitats of Sitta przewalskii and the white-cheeked nuthatch (Sitta leucopsis) are separated from each other by almost 1,500 km (930 mi),  ",1
245,"Przevalski's nuthatch was described as closely related to the white-cheeked nuthatch, and was thereafter often considered and treated conspecifically, as a subspecies of S. leucopsis.   ",1
246,"In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen granted the taxon autonomous status in her book, Birds of South Asia. ",0
247,"The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. Collar and John D. Pilgrim in 2007,  and endorsed by the International Ornithological Congress, by Alan P. Peterson in his well-known Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen),  and by the Internet Bird Collection (IBC), sponsored by the Handbook of the Birds of the World.  ",1
248,"In explaining this separation of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and significant differences in vocalization.  ",1
249,"Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, and that it would be instructive to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other.  ",1
250,"The white-cheeked nuthatch, with S. przewalskii subsumed within it, has been regarded as closely related to the North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), which has a similar contact call (though S. carolinensiss's is moderately higher in pitch), and they have sometimes been treated as conspecific. ",0
251,"In turn, it has been proposed that the triumvirate of S. przewalskii, S. leucopsis and S. carolinensis could be related to the Sitta canadensis, monophyletic group, corresponding to the subgenus Micrositta, which includes six species of average-sized nuthatches.  ",1
252,The relationships remain very unclear.    A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity.  ,1
253,"In 2014, Eric Pasquet, et al. published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. ",0
254,"Though S. leucopsis was not included in the study, it found that within the nuthatch group covered, S. przewalskii is basalâan ancestor at the base (or root)âto the nuthatch evolutionary family tree, and thus ""sister to all other nuthatches, without any close relatives"".  ",1
255,The findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses (employing Bayesian inference and the maximum likelihood methods). ,0
256,"The cladogram drawn from the evidence indicates that the first clade and closest descendants of Przevalski's nuthatch are the North American white-breasted nuthatch and the giant nuthatch (S. magna), dispelling the hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.  ",1
257,"Because Sitta przewalskii has long been regarded as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it.  ",1
258,"Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. ",0
259,"S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner.   ",1
260,"Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance,  except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.  ",1
261,"The area above the eyes, including the forehead, crown and nape, is a deep blue-black, through the top edge of the mantle. ",0
262,"The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. ",0
263,"The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.  ",1
264,"The face and surrounding areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange.   ",1
265,"Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon at the sides of the breast. ",0
266,"In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. ",0
267,"The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. ",0
268,"Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.  ",1
269,"Przevalski's nuthatch is a medium-sized bird, measuring about 12.5â13 cm (4.9â5.1 in) in length.   ",1
270,The folded wing of the male is 72â77 mm (2.8â3.0 in) long and that of the female 69â74 mm (2.7â2.9 in); an average of 4 mm (0.16 in) shorter than the white-cheeked nuthatch. ,0
271,"The beak measures 17â17.6 mm (0.67â0.69 in), which is thinner and shorter than that of S. leucopsis, in which the beak is approximately 21 mm (0.83 in) long.  ",1
272,"The tarsus is 18 mm (0.71 in), and the tail is 43 mm (1.7 in) in length.  ",1
273,"According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, vocalizations include a ""muffled, mellow 'chip' repeated in irregular series ; a loud, emphatic, whistled 'dweep' or 'dweep-eep'; a slightly nasal, querulous 'que', usually repeated 3â5 times ; and thinner 'pee-pee-pee-pee ' or 'seet-seet-seet-seet ' notes onthe] same pitch but slowing towardsthe] end ofthe] phrase. ",0
274,"In 1950, English naturalist Frank Ludlow reported a description of the bird, as provided to him by Ernst SchaÌfer who studied an adult male near Litang in 1934. ",0
275,"It was characterized as: ""one of the shyest and rarest denizens of the conifer forest"",  and one leading a solitary life, much like nearby populations of three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus funebris). ",1
276,"By contrast, Ludlow observed the species in southeastern Tibet, probably during the winter, and did not find it particularly reserved. ",0
277,"He reports having killed a specimen in a willow tree, far from the species' usual coniferous nesting grounds.  ",1
278,"The specimen was captured on the outskirts of a forest, on a ridge between two valleys, where it stood on a dead branch from which it launched in pursuit of insects in flight, like a flycatcher.   ",1
279,The species is endemic to an area in west central China and southeastern Tibet.  ,1
280,"In China, it is found in eastern Qinghai, from the Daba Mountains as far north as the Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, and as far south as the plateau of Amdo (35Â° N. 101Â° E.), as well as in the southern part of Qinghai in NangqeÌn County; in the area of the Yellow River in Xinghai County; in Gansu, southwest of Xiahe and Min counties; in Sichuan, where it has been observed in the north, center and west of the province, including sightings in Songpan County at the Jiuzhaigou Valley nature reserve, in the Qionglai Mountains in the Wolong District, in the region of Barkam County, and in the area of Litang. ",0
281,"The species has also been observed in Kunming, Yunnan, in far southwestern China, where it most likely migrates to overwinter.  ",1
282,"In Tibet, the species has been found in the northeastern Tibet Autonomous Region in the Chamdo Prefecture; and in the southeast of the region in Tse (in December) and in Dzeng (in April), both in the South Tibet (Tsangpo) Valley region. ",0
283,"The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous, only indicating winter visitation. ",0
284,"The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species' normal coniferous forest environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch.  ",1
285,"In China it has been observed at height distributions of 4,270 m (14,010 ft) (in Sichuan during August) and in Qinghai at 2,590â2,895 m (8,497â9,498 ft) and at approximately 2,250 m (7,380 ft) (during June). ",0
286,"In western Nepal a range of 2,745â4,575 m (9,006â15,010 ft) has been described. ",0
287,"In Tibet individuals have been recorded at heights of 3,500â4,500 m (11,500â14,800 ft) in the northeast, and from 2,895â3,050 m (9,498â10,007 ft) in the southeast.   Sitta przewalskii is not yet treated as an independent species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and its threat level is not evaluated by either. ",1
288,"Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet,  because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species.  ",1
289,"As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.

290,"The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), also known as the Puerto Rican parrot, cotorra puertorriquenÌa or iguaca, is the only extant parrot endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico, and belongs to the Neotropical genus Amazona. ",0
291,"Measuring 28â30 cm (11.0â11.8 in), the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. ",0
292,"Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. ",0
293,Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon and the Hispaniolan amazon. ,0
294,The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at between three and four years of age. ,0
295,Once the female lays eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. ,0
296,The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. ,0
297,"This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy. ",0
298,The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994. ,0
299,"Once widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely vanished from Vieques and Mona Island, nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. ",0
300,Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. ,0
301,"The Puerto Rican amazon was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux.  ",1
302,The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by FrancÌ§ois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches EnlumineÌes D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  ,1
303,"Buffon mistaken believed that his specimen had been collected in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti), rather than in Puerto Rico.   ",1
304,The Puerto Rican amazon is now placed in the large Neotropical genus Amazona  that was introduced by the French naturalist ReneÌ Lesson in 1830.   ,1
305,"They have also been given the generic epithet of ""parrot"" by the American Ornithologists' Union, and hence ""Puerto Rican parrot"" is an alternative common name in North America.  ",1
306,"The indigenous TaiÌno people called it the iguaca, an onomatopoeic name that resembled the parrots' flight call.  ",1
307,There are two recognized subspecies: A. albifrons A. agilis A. collaria A. ventralis A. leucocephala A. vittata ,0
308,"There is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point. ",0
309,"Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate ""over-water"" dispersion.  ",1
310,"Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central, North and South America.  ",1
311,"Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean Amazona descend from Amazona albifrons with Amazona vittata, Amazona leucocephala, and Amazona ventralis constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade.  ",1
312,"All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes.  ",1
313,The Amazona species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the Greater Antilles and seven large species in the Lesser Antilles.  ,1
314,"British ornithologist David Lack considered that the Puerto Rican amazon had evolved from the Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon.  ",1
315,"Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same species.  ",1
316,Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.  ,1
317,The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis.  ,1
318,"The Puerto Rican amazon measures 28â30 cm (11.0â11.8 in) and weighs 250â300 g (8.8â10.6 oz), or 275 g (9.7 oz) on average. ",0
319,"Although small compared to amazons in general, it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles Amazona species. ",0
320,"Both males and females have predominantly green plumage, though their feathers have blue edges. ",0
321,The primary flight feathers of the wings and the main covert feathers are dark blue. ,0
322,"The color of the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part: the feathers on the underside of the wings, which can be seen during flight, are bright blue; those in the tail have yellow-green tone. ",0
323,"Their underparts are paler and yellow-tinged, their foreheads are red, and they have white ovals around the eyes. ",0
324,"The iris is brown, the bill a horn color, and the legs yellow-tan.  ",1
325,"Aside from DNA tests, males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral differences during the breeding season. ",0
326,"The precise distribution of the Puerto Rican amazon before the arrival of Spanish colonialists is uncertain, because of a lack of contemporary records and then the extermination of the indigenous TaiÌno people, but the species was apparently widespread and abundant.  ",1
327,"There is also evidence the species may have inhabited other nearby islands, such as Antigua, Barbuda  and the Virgin Islands.   ",1
328,"Some authorities claim that there were once more than a million individuals,  while others suggest a more modest population of 100,000. ",1
329,"During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small, and in 1650, when the population of the island was 880 people, the species was still abundant throughout the archipelago.  ",1
330,"After 1650, human habitation increased exponentially, and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican amazon population started to be affected. ",0
331,"Heinrich Moritz Gaede, a German naturalist, declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined.  ",1
332,"Even so, as late as 1864, British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that the parrots were still common near the island's capital, San Juan.  ",1
333,"At first, human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican amazon. ",0
334,The TaiÌno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population.  ,1
335,"In the past 200 years, however, many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets.  ",1
336,"Especially during the latter half of the 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. ",0
337,The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible.  ,1
338,"As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined. ",0
339,"The species was historically found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. ",0
340,"The species could be found at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s).  Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's coast to find food.  ",1
341,The species was extirpated from Culebra by the early 20th century.  ,1
342,A karst-limestone region in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico was identified as a haven for the species. ,0
343,"In particular, a region named Valle de las Cotorras (Valley of the Parrots), located between San SebastiaÌn and Morovis, was home to a sizable population.  ",1
344,By 1960 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest.  ,1
345,"The species is currently found at elevations between 396 and 823 m (1,299 and 2,700 ft). ",0
346,"Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for reproduction, it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests. ",0
347,"By the 1950s, there were only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. ",0
348,"Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. ",0
349,"But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. ",0
350,In the aftermath of the hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. ,0
351,"In 2004, the wild population was 30â35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations.   ",1
352,"The current range of the species is 16 km2 (6.2 sq mi), 0.2% of what it once was. ",1
353,"The Puerto Rican amazon is diurnal, typically beginning its day half an hour after sunrise.  ",1
354,"It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its green plumage as camouflage. ",0
355,"In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest. ",0
356,"Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest. ",0
357,"The flight mechanism of this species is similar to the one found in other amazons, and involves strokes below the body axis, unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight. ",0
358,"Amazons can fly moderately fast, reaching a top speed of approximately 30 km/h (19 mph), and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid-air.  ",1
359,Couples and their fledged young display a tendency to stay together.  ,1
360,"The amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off squawk which consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud ""bugle"", commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used.  ",1
361,"Like almost all amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. ",0
362,"Its diet consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest's canopy. ",0
363,"The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. ",0
364,"Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera).  ",1
365,"It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in front of its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions.  ",1
366,"When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food.  ",1
367,"The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8â60 seconds to consume separate items.  ",1
368,"The Puerto Rican amazon usually mates for life, with pairs only changing mates if one bird perishes or abandons the nest.  ",1
369,"A male may abandon the female if the latter is injured, re-mating with a more ""physically perfect"" subject.  ",1
370,"The pairing process is unknown; however, new pairs tend to participate in mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows, partial extension of the wings and full tail expansion.  ",1
371,"The Puerto Rican amazon is a secondary cavity nester, nesting in tree trunk cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. ",0
372,"It prefers to nest in Palo colorado trees (Cyrilla racemiflora), but uses other trees, including the laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens) and tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), to a lesser extent. ",0
373,These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water. ,0
374,"Recently, the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species. ",0
375,"The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final decision seems to be taken by the female.  ",1
376,"Once a site is selected, the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it. ",0
377,The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity. ,0
378,The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). ,0
379," Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back.  ",1
380,"Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse. ",1
381,"As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation.  ",1
382,"The female lays 2â4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food.  ",1
383,Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame.  ,1
384,"The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch.  ",1
385,"Like other amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is gregarious while performing daily activities, but territorial around its nest.  ",1
386,"Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.  ",1
387,The size of the territory around the nest is usually around 50 meters (164 feet).  ,1
388,"Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators.  ",1
389,"Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. ",0
390,Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat.  ,1
391,Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone.  ,1
392,"Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest, with these tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season. ",0
393,"One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity, serving as ""practice territoriality"".  ",1
394,"On March 11, 1967, the Puerto Rican amazon entered the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species.  ",1
395,At the time of inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals. ,0
396,"In 1968, recovery efforts began to increase the population in the wild.  ",1
397,"In 1972, when the estimated population was 16 individuals, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good results. ",0
398,"In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks (the yearly average is around 16). ",0
399,"In 2006, 22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild population, and a further 19 were released at the same site on 27 December 2008.  ",1
400,"In 2012, the total estimated population was 58â80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.  ",1
401,The World Conservation Union (IUCN) lists the Puerto Rican amazon as a critically endangered species since 1994.  ,1
402,"The species is regulated under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),  rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts. ",1
403,Human activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon.  ,1
404,"Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the TaiÌno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. ",0
405,"Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. ",0
406,The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main reason for the decline of population. ,0
407,"Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon include the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus).   ",1
408,"The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders.  Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.  ",1
409,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, were not a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot population when it was more readily self-maintaining, but as a result of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. ",0
410,"Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.  ",1
411,"In response to the Puerto Rican amazon's low population and endangered status, a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968. ",0
412,Its main objective was to downlist the species to threatened status by the year 2020.  ,1
413,"Other objectives included establishing two separate viable wild populations (each of which would consist of 500 or more individuals for a period of at least five years), protecting habitat for those populations, and controlling predators, parasites and competitors. ",0
414,A third site was planned in 2011 by the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex.  ,1
415,"As part of the conservation efforts, a captive population was established in the Luquillo Aviary in 1973.  ",1
416,Another was established in 1993 when some individuals were transferred from the Luquillo Aviary to the Rio Abajo State Forest under the administration of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources (Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales).  ,1
417,"In 2007, expanded facilities at the Iguaca Aviary at the El Yunque National Forest were inaugurated and dedicated to the late Priscilla Stubbe, who was a major fundraiser for the new facility.  ",1
418,Human activity once again threatened the amazon during the following years. ,0
419,"In 2012, it was reported that the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species.  ",1
420,"Via Verde, a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis FortunÌo administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed.  ",1
421,"In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at MayaguÌez sequenced the amazon's genome.  ",1
422,"On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the RiÌo Abajo State Forest was announced.  ",1
423,"Experts considered this a sign of expansion, implying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. ",0
424,"This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. ",0
425,"This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.  ",1
426,"The creation of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with the municipalities of Maricao and Isabela being analyzed.  ",1
427,"In November 2013, plans for the establishment of a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced.  ",1
428,"The following month, ten amazons were released at RiÌo Abajo.  2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011.  ",1
429,"The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year.  ",1
430,"During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals.  ",1
431,"A severe drought caused by the emergence of El NinÌo began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season.  ",1
432,"However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population.  ",1
433,"On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao.  ",1
434,"Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.  ",1
435,"To assist in improving the understanding of the overall population health of this species and aid in captive breeding programs the genome was sequenced by researchers at University of Puerto Rico, MayaguÌez.  ",1
436,"As an emblematic species of Puerto Rico, this was carried out as a uniquely community-funded project.  ",1
437,The research budget raised by student organized art and fashion shows dedicated to the effort plus small personal donations from Puerto Rican citizens who wanted to support the work.  ,1

439,"The rainbow pitta (Pitta iris) is a small passerine bird in the pitta family, Pittidae, endemic to northern Australia,  most closely related to the superb pitta of Manus Island. ",0
440,"It has a velvet black head with chestnut stripes above the eyes, olive green upper parts, black underparts, a bright red belly and an olive green tail. ",0
441,"An Australian endemic, it lives in the monsoon forests and in some drier eucalypt forests. ",0
442,"Like other pittas, the rainbow is a secretive and shy bird. ",0
443,"Pairs defend territories and breed during the rainy season, as that time of year provides the most food for nestlings. ",0
444,The female lays three to five blotched eggs inside its large domed nest. ,0
445,"Both parents defend the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. ",0
446,"Although the species has a small global range, it is locally common and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as being of least concern. ",0
447,"The rainbow pitta was described by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in 1842, which is based on a specimen collected on the Cobourg Peninsula in the Northern Territory of Australia.   ",1
448,The specific name iris is taken from the Ancient Greek for ,0
449,"""rainbow"";  this is the origin of the common name as well.  ",1
450,"The species was once treated as a subspecies of the noisy pitta of eastern Australia,  and was also treated as being in a species complex with that species, the elegant pitta and the black-faced pitta,  although that arrangement was not universally accepted.  ",1
451,According to the 2006 study of the nuclear DNA of the pittas and other Old World suboscines found that its closest relative was the superb pitta of Manus Island off the coast of Papua New Guinea. ,0
452,"The same study resulted in the pitta family being split from one genus into three, this species remaining in the genus Pitta.  ",1
453,"The species was long thought to be monotypic,  but in 1999 the Western Australian population was split into the subspecies P. i. johnstoneiana by Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason.  ",1
454,"The rainbow pitta is 16 to 18 cm (6.3â7.1 in) in length,  and weighs 52â88 g (1.8â3.1 oz). ",1
455,"Females weigh 67 g (2.4 oz), slightly more on average than males, which weigh 62 g (2.2 oz).  ",1
456,"It typically stands upright while looking for food or resting, with the legs slightly bent, and the body held at a 60â70Â° angle. ",0
457,"Its head, neck, breast, flanks and upper belly are velvet black, its upper parts are olive-green, and its lower belly and undertail coverts are scarlet red. ",0
458,"The wings are green with a golden sheen and have a shining blue patch on the lesser wing coverts, and the flight feathers and underwing are black. ",0
459,The tail is olive-green with a black base and the uppertail coverts sometimes have a silvery-blue band across them.  ,1
460,"It has a black bill, pink legs, brown eyes and a chestnut stripe along each side of its crown.  ",1
461,"Many individuals display the pitta family's characteristic dark streaks, which can be arrow-shaped or stripes, through the middle of the feathers of the upper part of the body; examination of study skins have found around 60% of rainbow pittas have them. ",0
462,"This varies somewhat regionally, as birds from Darwin were found to have none.  ",1
463,Uniquely in the pitta family the streaks are not dusky or blackish but are instead bronze-coloured in this species.  ,1
464,"The plumage is essentially the same for both sexes; females may have slightly more buff-yellow in their flanks and a slightly different shade of red on the lower belly, but these differences do not make the sexes distinguishable by plumage.  ",1
465,"The subspecies P. i. johnstoneiana is very similar to the nominate race, except the chestnut eyebrow is larger, as is the wing-spot, but the bird overall is slightly smaller.  ",1
466,"The rainbow pitta is endemic to the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and is found from sea-level to 380 m (1,250 ft). ",0
467,"In the Northern Territory it is found in the Top End, from Darwin east to the edge of the Arnhem Escarpment. ",0
468,Further east it is found on Groote Eylandt  and the Wessel Islands.  ,1
469,"In Western Australia it is restricted to the coastal Kimberley, from Walcott Inlet to Middle Osborn Island. ",0
470,It is also found on some of the islands of the Bonaparte Archipelago.  ,1
471,"It is found most commonly in monsoon forest and in adjacent vine-scrub and gallery forest, and also occurs in eucalypt forest, bamboo forests, paperbark forest and scrub, Lophostemon forests and the edges of mangrove forests (but never in mangrove forests themselves). ",0
472,"It is mostly found in closed forests, but is also found in more open forests.  ",1
473,"It has sometimes been found in plantations of introduced pines, and has even bred in that habitat.   ",1
474,This species is one of only two pittas that have been recorded feeding on open lawns in towns.  ,1
475,Some local movements to more marginal habitats have been recorded during the dry season. ,0
476,"Its movements can be difficult to trace during the post-breeding season, as it is silent during the annual moult, and generally shy throughout the year. ",0
477,"Young birds disperse from their parents' territories, seeking territories of their own. ",0
478,One banded juvenile was discovered 6.5 km (4.0 mi) from its natural territory.  ,1
479,The rainbow pitta has several calls and displays it uses to communicate with others of its kind. ,0
480,"Males call significantly more than females,  and a bird calls more during the breeding season. ",1
481,Over the course of a year a bird spends 12% of its day calling. ,0
482,"Calling starts an hour before dawn, and is most frequent around dawn, and then at any time before 10 am and after 4 pm.  ",1
483,"One common display is the bowing display, where the legs are held straight and the body held vertically, with the breast almost touching the ground. ",0
484,During this display the pitta makes a purring sound made at no other time. ,0
485,"This display is territorial, and is performed by neighbours along territorial boundaries, one bird displaying after another. ",0
486,The display and purring call are adapted to be noticeable in the dim light of the forest floor yet not so conspicuous so as to attract predators.  ,1
487,"The most commonly given call ""teow-whit, teow-whit"" or ""choowip-choowip"" is probably territorial as well.   ",1
488,"A defensive behaviour of this species is wing-flicking, where the wings are half-opened for a second every five seconds. ",0
489,"This behaviour is paired with a ""keow"" call, and is made when potential predators approach closely to a nest. ",0
490,"It will also perform a wing-spreading display when predators are close to the nest, standing vertically and suddenly flashing open its wings. ",0
491,This behaviour may distract the attention of predators away from the nest. ,0
492,"When an adult itself is threatened, it may adopt a ducking posture, holding its breast down to the ground and its tail up high.  ",1
493,Nesting pairs engage in a simple ritual when relieving their partner during incubation. ,0
494,The parent arriving will sit on a branch near the nest and issue a disyllabic whistle two or three times. ,0
495,"On hearing this the incubating bird leaves without making a sound, and the relieving parent takes their place.  ",1
496,The rainbow pitta is unusual among the avifauna in its range for foraging exclusively on the ground.  ,1
497,"The diet of the rainbow pitta is dominated by insects and their larvae, other arthropods, snails and earthworms. ",0
498,"Near Darwin, two thirds of the diet was earthworms; these are mostly taken during the rainy season from October to April. ",0
499,"Insects and other arthropods are more commonly taken in the dry season;  insects and arthropods taken include cockroaches, beetles, ants, caterpillars and grasshoppers, centipedes, spiders and millipedes.  ",1
500,"It will also take Carpentaria fruits that have fallen to the ground, as well as frogs and lizards.  ",1
501,"The species forages individually by hopping on the forest floor, then pausing to scan; leaves and soil are scratched by the feet and leaves may be flicked away by the bill.  ",1
502,"When feeding on snails, it breaks them out of the shells using roots as an anvil.   ",1
503,"Unlike the noisy pitta, it only uses roots and branches as anvils, not stones. ",0
504,"Larger prey like large centipedes are shaken and dropped, then the bird retreats for a few seconds before repeating the process.  ",1
505,"The rainbow pitta is monogamous during the breeding season, but does not form lifelong bonds. ",0
506,"Breeding in this species is seasonal, running from December through April. ",0
507,"A pair may stay together the following year after breeding, but they are more likely to find new partners.  ",1
508,"The first rains of the rainy season seem to be the trigger for nest building, as the breeding season seems to be correlated with the availability of earthworms, a major part of the diet of both nestlings and adults during this time.  ",1
509,Breeding territories vary in size from 1.6 to 3.1 ha (4.0â7.7 acres); territories are larger in drier forest.  ,1
510,"Nesting sites are placed randomly through the pair's territory, although second nests in a year are placed some distance from nests used earlier that season. ",0
511,Nests are not used more than once; if the pair lay a new clutch in a season then a new nest is constructed. ,0
512,"Unlike the noisy pitta, which mostly places its nests close to the ground, the rainbow pitta only rarely places its nest close to the ground, possibly because its habitat floods more readily. ",0
513,"It does place its nest anywhere from ground level up to 20 m (66 ft) up a tree, and the same pair can show similar variation in location within a nesting season. ",0
514,"The nest can be placed in the fork of a tree, at the top of palms, on horizontal branches, in tangles of vines or against the buttress roots of a tree.  ",1
515,"A nest takes about a week to build, and is built by both parents. ",0
516,"It starts as a platform of twigs, over which is built a dome. ",0
517,"The enclosed nest is then lined with bark and leaves before a final lining of finer fibres, fern fronds and rootlets.  ",1
518,"One unusual feature of rainbow pitta nests, shared only with the noisy pitta in this family, is the addition of wallaby dung pellets to the entrance of the nest. ",0
519,"In a study of 64 nests in the Northern Territory, 34% were decorated in this way. ",0
520,"The function of the dung is uncertain; it has been suggested that the scent disguises the smell of eggs, nestlings or incubating adults from nest predators, but researchers found that decorated nests were preyed upon as frequently as clean nests. ",0
521,Entrances may also be decorated with other objects such as dingo hair or feathers; the function of this is also unknown but may be to communicate with others of the same species.  ,1
522,"The nests of pittas may be domed to protect them from nest predators, but evidence of this is inconclusive. ",0
523,"Nests are preyed upon by rodents and snakes, and nests are raided more often in monsoon forests than in eucalypt forests.  ",1
524,Nesting failure is high for this species; 12% of nests are preyed upon in eucalypt forests and 60% of nests in monsoon forests.  ,1
525,"An average clutch of rainbow pitta eggs contains four eggs, but some have three or five.  ",1
526,The eggs are rounded and white with sepia spots and blotches and underlying grey markings. ,0
527,They measure 26.2 mm Ã 21.2 mm (1.03 in Ã 0.83 in) on average.  ,1
528,Incubation stints last for an average of 87 minutes and the pair incubate their eggs for 90% of the daylight hours. ,0
529,"The chicks are born naked, with black skin and yellow claws. ",0
530,"Both parents feed the chicks, with an average time between feeds of just 7.5 minutes. ",0
531,"Their eyes open after four days,  and the down, when it comes in, is grey.  ",1
532,"They continue to be fed for between 15 and 20 days after leaving the nest, after which they are independent of their parents, and may even be driven out of the territory by their parents. ",0
533,"Having fledged one brood, some rainbow pittas may build a new nest and lay a second brood; in one study, two out of four closely studied pairs relaid. ",0
534,Pairs may even build the next nest while still feeding the previous brood.  ,1
535,The rainbow pitta is not thought to be in danger of extinction. ,0
536,It has a limited global distribution but is generally common throughout its range. ,0
537,"In Kakadu National Park it is found in densities of one bird per 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) . ",0
538,"The Western Australian subspecies P. i. johnstoneiana may not be doing as well, as feral cattle destroy its habitat and seem to be causing some declines, although this subspecies is poorly known.  ",1
539,Overall the rainbow pitta is evaluated as being of least concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  ,1
540,"The red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus) is a species of passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae. ",0
541,It is endemic to Australia and can be found near rivers and coastal areas along the northern and eastern coastlines from the Kimberley in the northwest to the Hunter Region in New South Wales. ,0
542,"The male adopts a striking breeding plumage, with a black head, upperparts and tail, and a brightly coloured red back and brown wings. ",0
543,The male in eclipse plumage and the juvenile resemble the female. ,0
544,"Two subspecies are recognised; the nominate M. m. melanocephalus of eastern Australia has a longer tail and orange back, and the short-tailed M. m. cruentatus from northern Australia has a redder back. ",0
545,"The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and supplements its diet with seed and small fruit. ",0
546,"The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. ",0
547,"It can be nomadic in areas where there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round in other parts of its range. ",0
548,Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. ,0
549,These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. ,0
550,"The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. ",0
551,Older males in breeding plumage are more likely to engage in this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. ,0
552,"As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females. ",0
553,"The red-backed fairywren was first collected from the vicinity of Port Stephens in New South Wales and described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as the black-headed flycatcher (Muscicapa melanocephala); its specific epithet derived from the Ancient Greek Î1⁄4ÎμÌÎ»Î±Ï, melas 'black' and ÎoÎμÏÎ±Î»Î·Ì, kephaleÌ 'head'.  ",1
554,"However, the specimen used by Latham was a male in partial moult, with mixed black and brown plumage and an orange back, and he named it for its black head. ",0
555,"A male in full adult plumage was described as Sylvia dorsalis, and the explorers Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield gave a third specimen from central Queensland the name Malurus brownii, honouring botanist Robert Brown. ",0
556,John Gould described Malurus cruentatus in 1840 from a short-tailed scarlet-backed specimen collected in Northwestern Australia by Benjamin Bynoe aboard HMS Beagle on its third voyage. ,0
557,The first three names were synonymised into Malurus melanocephalus by Gould who maintained his form as a separate species. ,0
558," Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is unrelated to the true wren family, Troglodytidae. ",0
559,"Ornithologist Tom Iredale proposed the common name ""elfin-wren"" in 1939, however this was not taken up. ",1
560,"It was previously classified as a member of the old world flycatcher family, Muscicapidae,   and later as a member of the warbler family, Sylviidae  before being placed in the newly recognised Australasian wren family, Maluridae in 1975.  ",1
561,"More recently, DNA analysis has shown that the family Maluridae is related to both the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) within the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.   ",1
562," Termed the bicoloured wrens by ornithologist Richard Schodde, these three species are notable for their lack of head patterns and ear tufts, and solid-coloured black or blue plumage with contrasting shoulder or wing colour; they replace each other geographically across northern Australia and New Guinea.  ",1
563,"It is one of eleven species in the genus Malurus and is closely related to both the Australian white-winged fairywren, and the white-shouldered fairywren of New Guinea. ",1
564,"George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was the first to classify the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species,  although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid from a broad hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. ",1
565,"Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, or smaller and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within the hybrid zone.  ",1
566,A molecular study published in 2008 focusing on the Cape York population found it was genetically closer to eastern forest populations than to those from the Top End. ,0
567,"The Cape York birds became segregated around 0.27 million years ago, but gene flow still continues with eastern birds.  Two subspecies are currently recognised:  ",1
568,"Ornithologist Richard Schodde has proposed that the ancestors of the two subspecies were separated during the last glacial period in the Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago. ",0
569,"Aridity had pushed the grasslands preferred by the wren to the north, and with subsequent wetter warmer conditions it once again spread southwards and met the eastern form in northern Queensland and intermediate forms arose.  ",1
570,The distribution of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. ,0
571,"Populations then became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, while Australian forms evolved into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.  ",1
572,"A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the red-backed and white-shouldered fairywrens diverged from each other around 3 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 5 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-winged fairywren.  ",1
573,"The smallest member of the genus Malurus, the red-backed fairywren measures 11.5 cm (4 1â2 in) and weighs between 5â10 g (0.18â0.35 oz), averaging around 8 g (0.28 oz). ",0
574,"The 6 cm (2 1â4 in) long tail is black in the breeding male, and brown in eclipse males, females and juvenile birds.  ",1
575,"Averaging 8.6 mm (0.3 in), the bill is relatively long, narrow, pointed and wider at the base.  ",1
576,"Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing or picking insects off of their environs.  ",1
577,"Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism; the male adopts full breeding plumage by the fourth year, later than all other fairywrens apart from the closely related white-winged fairywren.  The male in breeding plumage has a black head and body with striking red back and brown wings. ",1
578,At other times it has a brown upper body and white underparts. ,0
579,The female looks remarkably similar with a buff brown body and a yellowish spot under the eye.  ,1
580,The female of this species differs from those of other fairywren species in that it lacks a blue tint in the tail.  ,1
581,"Geographically, it follows Gloger's rule; female birds have whiter bellies and paler brown upperparts inland in sunnier climates.  ",1
582,"The typical song used by the red-backed fairywren to advertise its territory is similar to that of other fairywrens, namely a reel made up of an introductory note followed by repeated short segments of song, starting weak and soft and ending high and shrill with several syllables. ",0
583,"The call is mostly made by the male during mating season.   Birds will communicate with one another while foraging with a soft ssst, barely audible further than 10â15 m (33â49 ft) away. ",1
584,"The red-backed fairywren is endemic to Australia and can be seen along rivers and the coast from Cape Keraudren in northern Western Australia through the Kimberleys, Arnhem Land and the Gulf Country and into Cape York, with the Selwyn Range and upper reaches of the Flinders River as a southern limit. ",0
585,"It is also found on the nearby offshore islands Groote Eylandt, Sir Edmund Pellew, Fraser, Melville and Bathurst Islands. ",0
586,"Its range extends all the way down the east coast east of the Great Dividing Range to the Hunter River in New South Wales,  preferring wet, grassy tropical or sub-tropical areas, with tall grasses such as bladygrass (Imperata cylindrica), species of Sorghum, and Eulalia. ",1
587,"It is not a true migrant, although it may be locally nomadic due to changes in vegetation, and may leave its territory after the breeding season.  ",1
588,The species will retreat to fire-resistant cover at times of fire.  ,1
589,"The red-backed fairywren avoids arid habitats, and is replaced to the south of its range by the white-winged fairywren. ",1
590,"The red-backed fairywren is diurnal, and becomes active at dawn, and again in bursts throughout the day. ",0
591,They roost side-by-side in dense cover and engage in mutual preening.  ,1
592,"The usual form of locomotion is hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. ",0
593,"Its balance is assisted by a relatively long tail, which is usually held upright and is rarely still. ",0
594,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  ",1
595,Birds generally fly in a series of undulations for a maximum of 20 or 30 m (66 or 98 ft).  ,1
596,"In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, the change in vegetation may be so great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories more often than other fairywrens.  ",1
597,"They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas.  ",1
598,"Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.  ",1
599,Both the male and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the rodent-run display to distract predators from nests with young birds. ,0
600,"The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
601,"During the mating season, the male moults its brown feathers and displays a fiery red plumage. ",0
602,It may fluff out its red back and shoulder feathers so that they cover part of the wings in a puffball-display. ,0
603,"It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female.   ",1
604,It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. ,0
605,"Ninety percent of the time, this is presented to a female in what appears to be a courtship ritual. ",0
606,"In the remaining ten percent of instances, it presents to another male as an apparent act of aggression.  ",1
607,Over half the red-backed fairywrens in an area can be found in pairs during the mating season. ,0
608,This is apparently a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. ,0
609,"It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young.  ",1
610,Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. ,0
611,"Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. ",0
612,"A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating.  ",1
613,"Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. ",0
614,"This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. ",0
615,The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.  ,1
616,"The mating season lasts from August to February, and coincides with the arrival of the rainy season in northern Australia. ",0
617,"The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is not typical for other birds of the genus Malurus.  Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair.  ",1
618,"Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 12â15 cm high by 9â12 cm wide and bore a partly covered 3â6 cm diameter entrance,  whereas the latter average around 10â13 cm in height by 6â8 cm wide with a 2â4 cm ",1
619,"Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid.  ",1
620,"The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four,  and measure 14.5â17 Ã 10â13 mm; those of M. m. melanocephalus are a little larger than those of M. m. cruentatus.  ",1
621,The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. ,0
622,The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. ,0
623,The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. ,0
624,Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. ,0
625,They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.  ,1
626,"Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is predominantly insectivorous; they eat a wide variety of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. ",0
627,"Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet.  It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. ",1
628,"Adults and their young may be preyed upon by mammals such as the feral cat and red fox, reptiles such as goannas, rodents,  and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie, butcherbird species, blue-winged kookaburra, crows and ravens, and shrike-thrushes.[45 ",1
629,Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.  ,1
630,"The red-billed chough, Cornish chough or simply chough (/ËtÊÊf/ CHUF; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), is a bird in the crow family, one of only two species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. ",0
631,"Its eight subspecies breed on mountains and coastal cliffs from the western coasts of Ireland and Britain east through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia, India and China. ",0
632,"This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. ",0
633,"The red-billed chough pairs for life and displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. ",0
634,"It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey. ",0
635,"Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. ",0
636,"The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. ",0
637,"The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and the Gambia, where the bird does not occur. ",0
638,The red-billed chough was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Upupa pyrrhocorax.  ,1
639,"It was moved to its current genus, Pyrrhocorax, by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica.  ",1
640,"The genus name is derived from Greek ÏÏÏÏÎ¿ÌÏ (pyrrhos), ""flame-coloured"", and ÎoÎ¿ÌÏÎ±Î3⁄4 (korax), ""raven"".  ",1
641,"The only other member of the genus is the Alpine chough, Pyrrhocorax graculus.  ",1
642,"Chough was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw, Corvus monedula, based on its call. ",0
643,"The closest relatives of the choughs are the typical crows, Corvus, especially the jackdaws in the subgenus Coloeus.  ",1
644,"The similar red-billed species, formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as ""Cornish chough"" and then just ""chough"", the name transferring from one species to the other.  ",1
645,"The Australian white-winged chough,  Corcorax melanorhamphos, despite its similar shape and habits, is only distantly related to the true choughs, and is an example of convergent evolution.  There are eight extant subspecies, although differences between them are slight.  ",1
646,"P. p. primigenius, a subspecies that lived in Europe during the last ice age, which was described in 1875 by Alphonse Milne-Edwards from finds in southwest France.   ",1
647,"Detailed analysis of call similarity suggests that the Asiatic and Ethiopian races diverged from the western subspecies early in evolutionary history, and that Italian red-billed choughs are more closely allied to the North African subspecies than to those of the rest of Europe.  ",1
648,"The adult of the ""nominate"" subspecies of the red-billed chough, P. p. pyrrhocorax, is 39â40 centimetres (15â16 inches) in length, has a 73â90 centimetres (29â35 inches) wingspan,  and weighs an average 310 grammes (10.9 oz).  ",1
649,"Its plumage is velvet-black, green-glossed on the body, and it has a long curved red bill and red legs. ",0
650,"The sexes are similar (although adults can be sexed in the hand using a formula involving tarsus length and bill width)  but the juvenile has an orange bill and pink legs until its first autumn, and less glossy plumage.  ",1
651,The red-billed chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species of bird. ,0
652,"Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. ",0
653,"Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.  ",1
654,"The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call is clearer and louder than the similar vocalisation of the jackdaw, and always very different from that of its yellow-billed congener, which has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls.  ",1
655,"Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.  ",1
656,"The red-billed chough breeds in Ireland, western Great Britain, the Isle of Man, southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, the Alps, and in mountainous country across Central Asia, India and China, with two separate populations in the Ethiopian Highlands. ",0
657,"Its main habitat is high mountains; it is found between 2,000 and 2,500 metres (6,600 and 8,200 ft) in North Africa, and mainly between 2,400 and 3,000 metres (7,900 and 9,800 ft) in the Himalayas. ",0
658,"In the British Isles and Brittany it also breeds on coastal sea cliffs, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or machair. ",0
659,"In that mountain range it reaches 6,000 metres (20,000 feet) in the summer, and has been recorded at 7,950 metres (26,080 feet) altitude on Mount Everest.  ",1
660,It was formerly more widespread on coasts but has suffered from the loss of its specialised habitat.   ,1
661,"It tends to breed at a lower elevation than the Alpine chough,  that species having a diet better adapted to high altitudes.  ",1
662,"The red-billed chough breeds from three years of age, and normally raises only one brood a year,  although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations.  ",1
663,A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established.  ,1
664,"The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair;  in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr.  ",1
665,The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face.  ,1
666,"In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep.  Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar.  ",1
667,"The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.  ",1
668,"The chough lays three to five eggs 3.9 by 2.8 centimetres (1.5 by 1.1 inches) in size and weighing 15.7 grammes (0.55 oz), of which 6% is shell.  ",1
669,"They are spotted, not always densely, in various shades of brown and grey on a creamy or slightly tinted ground.  ",1
670,"The egg size is independent of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females.  ",1
671,"The female incubates for 17â18 days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. ",0
672,"The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days,  and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. ",1
673,"Juveniles have a 43% chance of surviving their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. ",0
674,"Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years,  although an age of 17 years has been recorded.  ",1
675,The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates with the number of young fledging each year and their survival rate. ,0
676,"Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.  ",1
677,"The red-billed chough's food consists largely of insects, spiders and other invertebrates taken from the ground, with ants probably being the most significant item.  ",1
678,The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will perch on the backs of wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites.  ,1
679,"Although invertebrates make up most of the chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn.  ",1
680,"The preferred feeding habitat is short grass produced by grazing, for example by sheep and rabbits, the numbers of which are linked to the chough's breeding success. ",0
681,Suitable feeding areas can also arise where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils.   ,1
682,"It will use its long curved bill to pick ants, dung beetles and emerging flies off the surface, or to dig for grubs and other invertebrates. ",0
683,"The typical excavation depth of 2â3 cm (1â1 in) reflects the thin soils which it feeds on, and the depths at which many invertebrates occur, but it may dig to 10â20 cm (4â8 in) in appropriate conditions.   ",1
684,"Where the two chough species occur together, there is only limited competition for food. ",0
685,"An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. ",0
686,"In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. ",0
687,"Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet.  ",1
688,"Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.  ",1
689,"The red-billed chough's predators include the peregrine falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings.     ",1
690,"In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies. ",0
691,This small insectivorous falcon is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its corvid neighbours. ,0
692,"The breeding success of the red-billed chough in the vicinity of the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).  ",1
693,"Red-billed choughs can acquire blood parasites such as Plasmodium, but a study in Spain showed that the prevalence was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species.  ",1
694,"This species is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host. ",1
695,"These low levels of parasitism contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of thrushes in Russia showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma.  ",1
696,"Red-billed choughs can also carry mites, but a study of the feather mite Gabucinia delibata, acquired by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. ",0
697,"It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens,  and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and antingârubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).  The red-billed chough has an extensive range, estimated at 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. ",1
698,"Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.  ",1
699,"However, the European range has declined and fragmented due to the loss of traditional pastoral farming, persecution and perhaps disturbance at breeding and nesting sites, although the numbers in France, Great Britain and Ireland may now have stabilised.  ",1
700,"The European breeding population is between 12,265â17,370 pairs, but only in Spain is the species still widespread. ",0
701,"Since in the rest of the continent breeding areas are fragmented and isolated, the red-billed chough has been categorised as ""vulnerable"" in Europe.  ",1
702,"In Spain, the red-billed chough has recently expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a 9,716 square kilometres (3,751 square miles)mi) study area. ",0
703,These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. ,0
704,"However, the populations with nest sites on buildings are threatened by human disturbance, persecution and the loss of old buildings.  ",1
705,Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. ,0
706,The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.  ,1
707,"A small group of wild red-billed chough arrived naturally in Cornwall in 2001, and nested in the following year. ",0
708,"This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a slowly expanding population has bred every subsequent year.  ",1
709,"In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in partnership with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. ",0
710,"The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. ",0
711,Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive breeding programme.  ,1
712,"In 2013, juveniles were released onto the north coast of Jersey using soft-release methods developed at Durrell. ",0
713,"Over the next five years, small cohorts of captive-bred choughs were released, monitored, and provided supplemental food.  ",1
714,"In Greek mythology, the red-billed chough, also known as 'sea-crow', was considered sacred to the Titan Cronus and dwelt on Calypso's 'Blessed Island',  where ""The birds of broadest wing their mansions form/ ",1
715,"Up to the eighteenth century, the red-billed chough was associated with fire-raising, and was described by William Camden as incendaria avis, ""oftentime it secretly conveieth fire sticks, setting their houses afire"".  ",1
716,"Daniel Defoe was also familiar with this story: It is counted little better than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.  Not all mentions of ""chough"" refer to this species. ",1
717,"Because of the origins of its name, when Shakespeare writes of ""the crows and choughs that wing the midway air""King Lear, act 4, scene 6] or Henry VIII's Vermin Act of 1532 is ""ordeyned to dystroye Choughes, Crowes and Rookes"", they are clearly referring to the jackdaw.  ",1
718,"The red-billed chough has a long association with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms.  ",1
719,"According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated into the body of a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle  and hence killing this bird was unlucky.  ",1
720,"Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.  ",1
721,"In English heraldry the bird is always blazoned as ""a Cornish chough"" and is usually shown ""proper"", with tinctures as in nature. ",0
722,"Since the 14th century, St Thomas Becket (d.1170), Archbishop of Canterbury, has retrospectively acquired an attributed coat of arms consisting of three Cornish choughs on a white field,  although as he died 30 to 45 years before the start of the age of heraldry,  in reality he bore no arms. ",1
723,These attributed arms appear in many English churches dedicated to him. ,0
724,"According to one legend, a chough strayed into  Canterbury Cathedral during Becket's murder, while another  suggests that the choughs are a canting reference to Becket's name, as they were once known as ""beckits"".  ",1
725,"However the latter theory does not stand up to scrutiny, as the use of the term ""beckit"" to mean a chough is not found before the 19th century.  ",1
726,"Regardless of its origin, the chough is still used in heraldry as a symbol of Becket, and appears in the arms of several persons and institutions associated with him, most notably in the arms of the city of Canterbury.  ",1
727,"In early heraldry Cornish choughs were borne in the arms only of Cornish persons, but during the reign of King Henry VIII (1509-1547) the practice of allocating them indiscriminately regardless of any connection of the grantee to Cornwall began under  Christopher Barker,  Garter Principal King of Arms, who granted a coat of arms displaying Cornish choughs to Cardinal Wolsey, whose arms continue to be borne by Christ Church, Oxford, founded by him. ",1
728,"In Britain, the Cornish chough was the emblem of the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS Hood and has been depicted on the stamps of the Isle of Man. ",0
729,"This species has been depicted on the stamps of Bhutan, The Gambia, Turkmenistan and Yugoslavia.  ",1
730,"It was named by Linnaeus in 1758, who considered it a bunting, but Ludwig Reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to the new genus Quelea. ",0
731,"Three subspecies are recognised, with Quelea quelea quelea occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, Q. q. aethiopica from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and Q. q. lathamii from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. ",0
732,"Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged flight feathers and a reddish bill. ",0
733,"Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. ",0
734,"The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. ",0
735,"It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. ",0
736,"The quelea feeds primarily on seeds of annual grasses, but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops. ",0
737,The usual pest-control measures are spraying avicides or detonating fire-bombs in the enormous colonies during the night. ,0
738,Extensive control measures have been largely unsuccessful in limiting the quelea population. ,0
739,"When food runs out, the species migrates to locations of recent rainfall and plentiful grass seed; hence it exploits its food source very efficiently. ",0
740,"It is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1.5 billion individuals. ",0
741,"It feeds in huge flocks of millions of individuals, with birds that run out of food at the rear flying over the entire group to a fresh feeding zone at the front, creating an image of a rolling cloud. ",0
742,The conservation status of red-billed quelea is least concern according to the IUCN Red List. ,0
743,The red-billed quelea was one of the many birds described originally by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae. ,0
744,"Classifying it in the bunting genus Emberiza, he gave it the binomial name of Emberiza quelea.  ",1
745,"He incorrectly mentioned that it originated in India, probably because ships from the East Indies picked up birds when visiting the African coast during their return voyage to Europe. ",0
746,"It is likely that he had seen a draft of Ornithologia, sive Synopsis methodica sistens avium divisionem in ordines, sectiones, genera, species, ipsarumque varietates, a book written by Mathurin Jacques Brisson that was to be published in 1760, and which contained a black and white drawing of the species. ",0
747,"The erroneous type locality of India was corrected to Africa in the 12th edition of Systema Naturae of 1766, and Brisson was cited. ",0
748,"Brisson mentions that the bird originates from Senegal, where it had been collected by Michel Adanson during his 1748-1752 expedition.  ",1
749," Also in 1766, George Edwards illustrated the species in colour, based on a live male specimen owned by a Mrs Clayton in Surrey. ",0
750,"He called the bird Moineau aÌ bec rouge du Senegal in French and Passer senegalensis erythrorynchos in Latin, both meaning ""red-billed Senegalese sparrow"". ",1
751,"He called it the ""Brazilian sparrow"", despite being unsure whether it came from Brazil or Angola.  ",1
752,"In 1850, Ludwig Reichenbach thought the species was not a true bunting, but rather a weaver, and created the genus name Quelea, as well as the new combination Q. quelea.  ",1
753,"The white-faced morph was described as a separate species, Q. russii.  ",1
754,"In the field, these are distinguished by differences in male breeding plumage. ",0
755,"Q. quelea spoliator was described by Phillip Clancey in 1960 on the basis of more greyish nonbreeding plumage of populations of wetter habitats of northeastern South Africa, Swaziland and southern Mozambique. ",0
756,"However, further analysis indicated no clear distinction in plumage between it and Q. quelea lathamii, with no evidence of genetic isolation.  ",1
757,"Q. quelea intermedia, described by Anton Reichenow in 1886 from east Africa, is regarded a synonym of subspecies aethiopica.  ",1
758,"Quelea quelea is locally called kwelea domo-jekundu in Swahili, enzunge in Kwangali, chimokoto in Shona, inyonyane in Siswati, thaha in Sesotho and ndzheyana in the Tsonga language.  ",1
759,"M.W. Jeffreys suggested that the term came from medieval Latin qualea, meaning ""quail"", linking the prodigious numbers of queleas to the hordes of quail that fed the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt.  ",1
760,The subspecies lathamii is probably named in honor of the ornithologist ,0
761,"John Latham. The name of the subspecies aethiopica refers to Ethiopia,  and its type was collected in the neighbouring Sennar province in today's Sudan.  ""Red-billed quelea"" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).  Other names in English include black-faced dioch, cardinal, common dioch, Latham's weaver-bird, pink-billed weaver, quelea finch, quelea weaver, red-billed dioch, red-billed weaver, Russ' weaver, South-African dioch, Sudan dioch and Uganda dioch.  ",1
762,"Based on recent DNA analysis, the red-billed quelea is the sister group of a clade that contains both other remaining species of the genus Quelea, namely the cardinal quelea (Q. cardinalis) and the red-headed quelea (Q. erythrops). ",0
763,"The genus belongs to the group of true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most closely related to the fodies (Foudia), a genus of six or seven species that occur on the islands of the western Indian Ocean. ",0
764,These two genera are in turn the sister clade to the Asian species of the genus Ploceus. ,0
765,"Outside the breeding season, the male lacks bright colours; it has a grey-brown head with dark streaks, whitish chin and throat, and a faint light stripe above the eyes. ",0
766,"At this time, the bill becomes pink or dull red and the legs turn flesh-coloured.  ",1
767,"The females resemble the males in non-breeding plumage, but have a yellow or orangey bill and eye-ring during the breeding season. ",0
768,"At other times, the female bill is pink or dull red.  ",1
769,Newborns have white bills and are almost naked with some wisps of down on the top of the head and the shoulders. ,0
770,"The eyes open during the fourth day, at the same time as the first feathers appear. ",0
771,"Older nestlings have a horn-coloured bill with a hint of lavender, though it turns orange-purple before the post-juvenile moult. ",0
772,"Young birds change feathers two to three months after hatching, after which the plumage resembles that of non-breeding adults, although the head is grey, the cheeks whitish, and wing coverts and flight feathers have buff margins. ",0
773,"At an age of about five months they moult again and their plumage starts to look like that of breeding adults, with a pinkish-purple bill.  ",1
774,Different subspecies are distinguished by different colour patterns of the male breeding plumage. ,0
775,"In the typical subspecies, Q. quelea quelea, breeding males have a buff crown, nape and underparts and the black mask extends high up the forehead. ",0
776,"In  Q. quelea lathamii the mask also extends high up the forehead, but the underparts are mainly white. ",0
777,"In Q. quelea aethiopica the mask does not extend far above the bill, and the underparts may have a pink wash. ",0
778,"There is much variability within subspecies, and some birds cannot be ascribed to a subspecies based on outward appearance alone. ",0
779,"Because of interbreeding, specimens intermediate between subspecies may occur where the ranges of the subspecies overlap,  such as at Lake Chad.  ",1
780,"The female pin-tailed whydah could be mistaken for the red-billed quelea in non-breeding plumage, since both are sparrow-like birds with conical red-coloured bills, but the whydah has a whitish brow between a black stripe through the eye and a black stripe above.  male Q. q. aethiopica in breeding plumage with pink wash, Uganda male Q. q. aethiopica in breeding plumage with a yellow wash on the head, Uganda Females in breeding plumage with yellow bills, South Africa female Q. q. aethiopica in non-breeding plumage, Ethiopia  Flying flocks make a distinct sound due to the many wing beats. ",1
781,"After arriving at the roost or nest site, birds keep moving around and make a lot of noise for about half an hour before settling in.  ",1
782,"The male sings in short bursts, starting with some chatter, followed by a warbling tweedle-toodle-tweedle.  ",1
783,"The red-billed quelea is mostly found in tropical and subtropical areas with a seasonal semi-arid climate, resulting in dry thornbush grassland, including the Sahel, and its distribution covers most of sub-Saharan Africa. ",0
784,"It avoids forests, however, including miombo woodlands and rain forests such as those in central Africa, and is generally absent from western parts of South Africa and arid coastal regions of Namibia and Angola. ",0
785,"Occasionally, it can be found as high as 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea-level, but mostly resides below 1,500 m (4,900 ft). ",0
786,"It visits agricultural areas, where it feeds on cereal crops, although it is thought to prefer seeds of wild annual grasses. ",0
787,It needs to drink daily and can only be found within about 30 km (19 mi) distance of the nearest body of water. ,0
788,"It is found in wet habitats, congregating at the shores of waterbodies, such as Lake Ngami, during flooding. ",0
789,"Red-billed queleas migrate seasonally over long distances in anticipation of the availability of their main natural food source, seeds of annual grasses. ",0
790,"The presence of these grass seeds is the result of the beginning of rains weeks earlier, and the rainfall varies in a seasonal geographic pattern. ",0
791,"The temporarily wet areas do not form a single zone that periodically moves back and forth across the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather consist of five or six regions, within which the wet areas ""move"" or ""jump"". ",0
792,Red-billed quelea populations thus migrate between the temporarily wet areas within each of these five to six geographical regions. ,0
793,"Each of the subspecies, as distinguished by different male breeding plumage, is confined to one or more of these geographical regions.  ",1
794,"In Nigeria, the nominate subspecies generally travels 300â600 km (190â370 mi) southwards during the start of the rains in the north during June and July, when the grass seed germinates, and is no longer eaten by the queleas. ",0
795,"When they reach the Benoue River valley, for instance, the rainy season has already passed and the grass has produced new seeds. ",0
796,"After about six weeks, the birds migrate northwards to find a suitable breeding area, nurture a generation, and then repeat this sequence moving further north. ",0
797,"Some populations may also move northwards when the rains have started, to eat the remaining ungerminated seeds. ",0
798,In Senegal migration is probably between the southeast and the northwest.  ,1
799,"In eastern Africa, the subspecies aethiopica is thought to consist of two sub-populations. ",0
800,"One moves from Central Tanzania to southern Somalia, to return to breed in Tanzania in February and March, followed by successive migrations to breed ever further north, the season's last usually occurring in central Kenya during May.",0
801," In southern Africa, the total population of the subspecies Q. quelea lathamii in October converges on the Zimbabwean Highveld. ",0
802,"The second group moves from northern and central Sudan and central Ethiopia in May and June, to breed in southern Sudan, South Sudan, southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, moving back north from August to October. ",1
803,"In November, part of the population migrates to the northwest to northwestern Angola, while the remainder migrates to the southeast to southern Mozambique and eastern South-Africa, but no proof has been found that these migration cohorts are genetically or morphologically divergent.  ",1
804,"The red-billed quelea is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 11â2 billion individuals.  ",1
805,"The species is specialised on feeding on seeds of annual grass species, which may be ripe, or still green, but have not germinated yet. ",0
806,"Since the availability of these seeds varies with time and space, occurring in particular weeks after the local off-set of rains, queleas migrate as a strategy to ensure year-round food availability. ",0
807,The consumption of a lot of food with a high energy content is needed for the queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas. ,0
808,"When breeding, it selects areas such as  lowveld with thorny or spiny vegetationâtypically Acacia speciesâbelow 1,000 m (3,300 ft) elevation. ",0
809,"Small groups of red-billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds (Ploceus) and bishops (Euplectes), and in western Africa they may join the Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus) and various estrildids. ",0
810,"While foraging for food, they may fly 50â65 km (31â40 mi) each day and return to the roosting or nesting site in the evening.  ",1
811,"Red-billed queleas may also roost together with weavers, estrildids and barn swallows.  ",1
812,"Their life expectancy is two to three years in the wild, but one captive bird lived for eighteen years.  ",1
813,"The red-billed quelea needs 300â800 mm (12â31 in) of precipitation to breed, with nest building usually commencing four to nine weeks after the onset of the rains.  :5, 12 Nests are usually built in stands of thorny trees such as umbrella thorn acacia (Vachellia tortilis), blackthorn (Senegalia mellifera) and sicklebush (Dichrostachys cinerea), but sometimes in sugar cane fields or reeds. ",1
814,"Colonies can consist of millions of nests, in densities of 30,000 per ha (12,000 per acre). ",0
815,At Malilangwe in Zimbabwe one colony was 20 km (12 mi) long and 1 km (0.6 mi ) wide.  ,1
816,"In southern Africa, suitable branches are stripped of leaves a few days in advance of the offset of nest construction.  ",1
817,"The male starts the nest by creating a ring of grass by twining strips around both branches of a hanging forked twig, and from there bridging the gaps in the circle his beak can reach, having one foot on each of the branchlets, using the same footholds and the same orientation throughout the building process. ",0
818,Two parallel stems of reeds or sugar cane can also be used to attach the nest from. ,0
819,They use both their bills and feet in adding the initial knots needed.  ,1
820,"As soon as the ring is finished the male displays, trying to attract a female, after which the nest may be completed in two days. ",0
821,"The entrance may be constructed after the egg laying has started, while the male works from the outside. :6   ",1
822,"A finished nest looks like a small oval or globular ball of grass, around 18 cm (7 in) high and 16 cm (6 in) wide, with a 2.5 cm (1 in) wide entrance high up one side,  sheltered by a shallow awning. ",1
823,"About six to seven hundred fresh, green grass strips are used for each nest.  ",1
824,This species may nest several times per year when conditions are favourable. :6 ,1
825,"These differences in plumage do not signal condition, probably serving instead for the recognition of individual birds. ",0
826,"However, the intensity of the red on the bills is regarded an indicator of the animal's quality and social dominance.  ",1
827,There are usually three eggs in each clutch (though the full range is one to five) of approximately 18 mm (0.71 in) long and 13 mm (0.51 in) in diameter. ,0
828,Red-billed quelea males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle. :7 ,1
829,"The eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour, sometimes with some dark spots. ",0
830,"Some clutches contain six eggs, but large clutches may be the result of other females dumping an egg in a stranger's nest.  ",1
831,"Both sexes share the incubation of the eggs during the day, but the female alone does so during the cool night, and feeds during the day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain the development of the embryo. :7 ",1
832,The breeding cycle of the red-billed quelea is one of the shortest known in any bird. ,0
833,"Incubation takes nine or ten days.  After the chicks hatch, they are fed for some days with protein-rich insects. ",1
834,The young birds fledge after about two weeks in the nest. ,0
835,"Flocks of red-billed queleas usually feed on the ground, with birds in the rear constantly leap-frogging those in the front to exploit the next strip of fallen seeds. ",0
836,"This behaviour creates the impression of a rolling cloud, and enables efficient exploitation of the available food. ",0
837,"One survey at Lake Chad showed that two thirds of the seeds eaten belonged to only three species: African wild rice (Oryza barthii), Sorghum purpureosericeum and jungle rice (Echinochloa colona).  ",1
838,"Red-billed queleas feed mainly on seeds from a wide range of species, including annual grasses of the genera Echinochloa, Panicum, Setaria, Sorghum, Tetrapogon and Urochloa.  ",1
839,"When the supply of these seeds runs out, seeds of cereals such as barley (Hordeum disticum), teff (Eragrostis tef), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), manna (Setaria italica), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum), oats (Avena aestiva), as well as buckwheat (Phagopyrum esculentum) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are eaten on a large scale. ",0
840,"Red-billed queleas have also been observed feeding on crushed corn from cattle feedlots, but entire maize kernels are too big for them to swallow. ",0
841,A single bird may eat about 15 g (0.53 oz) in seeds each day.  ,1
842,"As much as half of the diet of nestlings consists of insects, such as grasshoppers, ants, beetles, bugs, caterpillars, flies and termites, as well as snails and spiders.  ",1
843,"Breeding females consume snail-shell fragments and calcareous grit, presumably to enable egg-shell formation.  ",1
844,"Insects are generally eaten during the breeding season, though winged termites are eaten at other times.  ",1
845,"One colony in Namibia, of an estimated five million adults and five million chicks, was calculated to consume roughly 13 t (29,000 lb) of insects and 1,000 t (2,200,000 lb) of grass seeds during its breeding cycle.  ",1
846,"In the heat of the day, they rest in the shade, preferably near water, and preen. ",0
847,"Natural enemies of the red-billed quelea include other birds, snakes, warthogs, squirrels, galagos, monkeys, mongooses, genets, civets, foxes, jackals, hyaenas, cats, lions and leopards. ",0
848,"In the evening, they once again fly off in search of food. :11 ",1
849,"Bird species that prey on queleas include the lanner falcon, tawny eagle and marabou stork. ",0
850,The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite that probably lays eggs in nests of queleas. ,0
851,"Some predators, such as snakes, raid nests and eat eggs and chicks. ",0
852,"Nile crocodiles sometimes attack drinking queleas, and an individual in Ethiopia hit birds out of the vegetation on the bank into the water with its tail, subsequently eating them.  ",1
853,Queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by African helmeted turtles in Etosha.  ,1
854,Among the invertebrates that kill and eat youngsters are the armoured bush cricket (Acanthoplus discoidalis) and the scorpion Cheloctonus jonesii.  ,1
855,The red-billed quelea is caught and eaten in many parts of Africa. ,0
856,"Around Lake Chad, three traditional methods are used to catch red-billed queleas. ",0
857,"Trappers belonging to the Hadjerai tribe use triangular hand-held nets, which are both selective and efficient. ",0
858,Each team of six trappers caught about twenty thousand birds each night. ,0
859,"An estimated five to ten million queleas are trapped near N'Djamena each year, representing a market value of approximately US$37,500â75,000. ",0
860,"Between 13 June and 21 August 1994 alone, 1.2 million queleas were caught. ",0
861,Birds were taken from roosts in the trees during the moonless period each night. ,0
862,"The feathers were plucked and the carcasses fried the following morning, dried in the sun, and transported to the city to be sold on the market. ",0
863,"The Sara people use standing fishing nets with a very fine mesh, while Masa and Musgum fishermen cast nets over groups of birds. ",0
864," Guano is collected from under large roosts in Nigeria and used as a fertiliser.  Tourists like to watch the large flocks of queleas, such as during visits of the Kruger National Park. ",1
865,The impact of hunting on the quelea population (about 200 million individuals in the Lake Chad Basin) is deemed insignificant.  ,1
866,"Woven traps made from star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) are used to catch hundreds of these birds daily in the Kondoa District, Tanzania. ",1
867,"The birds themselves eat pest insects such as migratory locusts, and the moth species Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exempta.  ",1
868,The animal's large distribution and population resulted in a conservation status listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  ,1
869,The red-billed quelea is sometimes kept and bred in captivity by hobbyists. ,0
870,"It thrives if kept in large and high cages, with space to fly to minimise the risk of obesity. ",0
871,"This species withstands frosts, but requires shelter from rain and wind. ",0
872,"Affixing hanging branches, such as hawthorn, in the cage facilitates nesting. ",0
873,"Adults are typically given a diet of tropical seeds enriched with grass seeds, augmented by living insects such as mealworms, spiders, or boiled shredded egg during the breeding season. ",0
874,"Fine stone grit and calcium sources, such as shell grit and cuttlebone, provide nutrients as well. ",0
875,If provided with material like fresh grass or coconut fibre they can be bred.  ,1
876,"Sometimes called ""Africa's feathered locust"",  the red-billed quelea is considered a serious agricultural pest in Sub-Saharan Africa.  ",1
877,"The governments of Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have regularly made attempts to lessen quelea populations. ",0
878,The most common method to kill members of problematic flocks was by spraying the organophosphate avicide fenthion from the air on breeding colonies and roosts. ,0
879,"In Botswana and Zimbabwe, spraying was also executed from ground vehicles and manually. ",0
880,"Attempts during the 1950s and '60s to eradicate populations, at least regionally, failed. ",0
881,"Consequently, management is at present directed at removing those congregations that are likely to attack vulnerable fields.[38The red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) is a tropicbird, one of three closely related species of seabird of tropical oceans. ",0
882,"Superficially resembling a tern in appearance, it has mostly white plumage with some black markings on the wings and back, a black mask and, as its common name suggests, a red bill. ",0
883,"Most adults have tail streamers that are about two times their body length, with those in males being generally longer than those in females. ",0
884,"The red-billed tropicbird itself has three subspecies recognized, including the nominate. ",0
885,"The subspecies mesonauta is distinguished from the nominate by the rosy tinge of its fresh plumage, and the subspecies indicus can be differentiated by its smaller size, more restricted mask, and more orange bill. ",0
886,"This species ranges across the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans. ",0
887,"The nominate is found in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the subspecies indicus in the waters off of the Middle East and in the Indian Ocean, and the subspecies mesonauta in the eastern portions of both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and in the Caribbean. ",0
888,It was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. ,0
889,"Nesting takes place in loose colonies, as they nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. ",0
890,A single egg is laid and is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. ,0
891,"Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. ",0
892,"After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. ",0
893,"Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. ",0
894,"The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird. ",0
895,"In some areas, introduced black and brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. ",0
896,"This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. ",0
897,"In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, this bird is considered to be threatened. ",0
898,"English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the red-billed tropicbird in the 17th century, having seen a specimen held by the Royal Society.  ",1
899,"It was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae,  and still bears its original scientific name, Phaethon aethereus. ",1
900,"The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek phaethon, ""sun"" while the species name comes from Latin aetherius, ""heavenly"".  ",1
901,This bird is called the red-billed tropicbird due to its red bill and its location in the tropicbird genus. ,0
902,"An alternative common name was ""bosun bird"", also spelt ""boatswain bird"", from the similarity of its shrill call to a boatswain's whistle.  ",1
903,An alternative derivation of the name is from the semblance of the tail feathers to marlin spikes.  ,1
904,"In a 1945 paper, American ornithologist Waldo Lee McAtee proposed it be called the barred-backed tropicbird after its most distinguishing feature.  ",1
905,"Local names used in the West Indies include ""truphit"", ""trophic"", ""white bird"", ""paille-en-queue"", ""paille-en-cul"", ""fleÌche-en-cul"", and ""feÌtu"".  ",1
906,"The red-billed tropicbird is basal (the earliest offshoot) in the genus Phaethon, the sole extant genus in the family Phaethontidae, the tropicbirds. ",0
907,"The split between this tropicbird and the other tropicbirds, the red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbird, is thought to have occurred about six million years ago.  ",1
908,"There are three subspecies, including the nominate, of this tropicbird: The red-billed tropicbird measures 90 to 105 cm (35 to 41 in) on average,  which includes the 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 in)-long tail streamers.  ",1
909,It has a wingspan of 99 to 106 cm (39 to 42 in).  ,1
910,"Its plumage is white, with black wing tips, and a back that is finely barred in black.  ",1
911,"It has a black mask that extends up from just above the lores to the sides of its nape, with gray mottling usually seen near the nape and hindneck. ",0
912,"The underparts are white, with some black on the outermost primaries and tertials and occasionally with black markings on the flanks. ",0
913,"The legs, base of the central toe, and parts of the outer toes are orange-yellow while the rest of the feet are black. ",0
914,The subspecies of this bird can usually be distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. ,0
915,"Although the sexes are similar,  the males are generally larger than females,  with the tail streamers being around 12 cm (4.7 in) longer on the male than on the female.  ",1
916,"The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upper wing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. ",0
917,"The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with a black cutting edge.  ",1
918,This down is eventually cleared in about 40 to 50 days.  ,1
919,The juvenile looks similar to the adult with a mostly white crown. ,0
920,"In the juvenile, the stripes above the eye usually are connected at the nape. ",0
921,The tail feathers usually have black tips or subterminal dots and without the tail streamers that are distinctive on the adult. ,0
922,"Occasionally, a juvenile will have black markings on its flanks and under tail coverts.  ",1
923,The red-billed tropicbird can be differentiated from the other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. ,0
924,"The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upper wing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill.  ",1
925,Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upper parts than juveniles of other species.  ,1
926,"In flight, the royal tern can be confused with the adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.  ",1
927,"This tropicbird moults once every year as an adult, following a complex basic strategy.  ",1
928,"This prebasic moult is completed before courtship and lasts between 19 and 29 weeks, with most being completed in 24 weeks.[19 ",0
929,] Birds gain their adult plumage at two to three years of age.  ,1
930,"The red-billed tropicbird usually only calls near breeding colonies, where it joins in with groups of other adults, numbering from 2 to 20, in circling above the sea and making loud, harsh kreeeee-kreeeee-kri-kri-kri-kr screams. ",0
931,"If disturbed at the nest, the chicks will vocalize a loud and piercing shriek, either rasping or reeling.  ",1
932,"The red-billed tropicbird has the smallest range of the three tropicbird species,  yet it still ranges across the Neotropics, as well as the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian oceans. ",1
933,"The nominate subspecies Phaethon aethereus aethereus breeds on islands in the Atlantic south of the equator, including Ascension, and Saint Helena on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos Archipelago in Brazilian waters. ",0
934,It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa.  ,1
935,"The subspecies P. a. mesonauta is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean.  ",1
936,"This subspecies was restricted to the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic but it has colonised the Canary Islands in the 21st century, especially Fuerteventura but also on other islands in that archipelago.  ",1
937,"The Indian Ocean subspecies, P. a. indicus is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka,  the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula.  ",1
938,The subspecies is also a rare but regular vagrant to Seychelles.  ,1
939,"Within the West Indies, this species is most common in the Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands and small islands east of ",0
940,Puerto Rico.  Breeding in the Western Palearctic occurs on the Cape Verde Islands and the IÌles des Madeleines off Senegal. ,1
941,"In 2000, the total number of pairs there was probably less than 150.  ",1
942,"In the Pacific Ocean, it breeds from the Gulf of California and Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico in the north, to the GalaÌpagos Islands, Isla Plata, Ecuador and San Lorenzo Island, Peru. ",0
943,"Researchers Larry Spear and David Ainley estimated the minimum population of the Pacific at around 15,750 birds in 1995 after 15 years of field observations.  ",1
944,"Red-billed tropicbirds disperse widely when not breeding, the juveniles more so than the adults,  with birds in the Pacific reaching the 45th parallel north off Washington State and 32nd parallel south off Chile,  with 19 records as of 2007 from Hawaiiâ some 4,300 kilometers (2,700 mi) from Mexico.  ",1
945,"It sometimes wanders further, including five records from Great Britain,  and two from Australia: OctoberâDecember 2010 on Lord Howe Island and September 2014 on Ashmore Reef.  ",1
946,"In July 2005, one was found in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, while another has been seen at Matinicus Rock, Maine regularly since 2000.   ",1
947,"The red-billed tropicbird can reach speeds of 44 kilometers per hour (27 mph) when flying out at sea,  cruising a minimum of 30 meters (100 ft) above the sea.  ",1
948,"It cannot stand and is not proficient at walking, and requires an unobstructed takeoff to fly from land.  ",1
949,"The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on isolated cliff faces,  in loose colonies.  ",1
950,"It uses a simple scrape nest,  located in a place it can easily take off from.  ",1
951,"The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was once seen breeding.  ",1
952,"In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally.  ",1
953,"For example, for islands in the California Current, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year round in the GalaÌpagos.  ",1
954,"Breeding is influenced by the availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in breeding.  ",1
955," Courtship and pairing usually lasts three to five weeks,  during which this bird performs aerial courtship displays to potential mates.  ",1
956,A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle. ,1
957,The courtship displays include flying in the air which takes the form of gliding interspersed with short periods of rapid wing- beating.  ,1
958,"In one display, a pair glide together for 100â300 meters (330â980 ft), with one bird around 30 cm (12 in) above the other. ",0
959,"The upper bird bends its wings down and the lower lifts its up, so they are almost touching. ",0
960,The two sink to about 6 meters (20 ft) above the sea before breaking off.  ,1
961,"Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites,  fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. ",1
962,"At nest sites, battles sometimes occur between two or more pairs before the original owners declare themselves as the owner of the nest.  ",1
963,Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.  ,1
964,They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs.  ,1
965,This tropicbird usually lays a clutch of one white buff to pale purple egg with reddish-brown spots. ,0
966,The egg usually measures 45 by 60 millimeters (1.8 by 2.4 in) and weighs around 67 grams (2.4 oz)â10% of the adult female's weight.  ,1
967,It is incubated by both sexes for 42 to 46 days. ,0
968,"If the egg does not survive the first few days in the nest, the female will usually lay a replacement egg.  ",1
969,"The chicks that hatch eventually fledge in about 10 to 15 weeks after hatching,  although most fledge after about 80 to 90 days.  ",1
970," Born helpless and unable to move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial),  the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body ",1
971,"Normally, the maximum weight of the chicks is about 725 grams (1.6 lb), but on years that are hotter than average, this can drop to about 600 grams (1.3 lb). ",1
972,"They grow their first feathersâscapularsâat 13â15 days, followed by primaries at 24â27 days, tail feathers at 30â35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days.  ",1
973,They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. ,0
974,"Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food.  ",1
975,"The parents can be seen at normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly.  ",1
976,"Chicks receive no care after fledging,  with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. ",1
977,"After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.  ",1
978,"Although it is a poor swimmer,  the red-billed tropicbird feeds on fish and squid.  ",1
979,"The fish are usually small, between about 10 and 20 cm (4 and 8 in), although some caught are up to 30 cm (12 in). ",0
980,"The aquatic prey is mostly caught by diving into the water from the air, although flying fish, the preferred fish of this species, are sometimes caught while in the air.  ",1
981,"Fish species eaten include Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema libertate), sharpchin flying fish (Fodiator acutus), flying fish of the genus Hirundichthys, sailfin flying fish (Parexocoetus brachypterus), ornamented flying fish (Cypselurus callopterus), bigwing halfbeak (Oxyporhamphus micropterus), longfin halfbeak (Hemiramphus saltator),  tropical two-wing flying fish (Exocoetus volitans), redlip blenny (Ophioblennius atlanticus), squirrelfish (Holocentrus adscensionis),  mackerel scad (Decapterus macarellus), shortjaw leatherjacket (Oligoplites refulgens), and mackerels (Scomber spp.).  ",1
982,"Squid eaten include the glass squid (Hyaloteuthis pelagica).  As they grow, the chicks are fed increasingly larger quantities of fish and squid by their parents,  generally partly digested and regurgitated.  ",1
983,"Most fish that the chicks are fed are below 6 cm (2.4 in) in length, although some fish fed to larger chicks can be up to 30 cm (12 in) in length.  ",1
984,"It usually dives into waters away from the coastline, diving from the air,  at heights up to 40 meters (130 ft).  ",1
985,"Sometimes, this bird follows predators that feed near the surface, such as dolphins or tuna. ",0
986,The red-billed tropicbird will feed on the fish driven either to or above the surface by the aforementioned predators.  ,1
987,"It usually forages in warmer waters, though does hunt in areas of cooler currents such as the Gulf of California. ",0
988,The species has also been recorded foraging in salt wedge estuaries.  ,1
989,"The red-billed tropicbird, a bird not indigenous to Bermuda, was displayed in error on the $50 Bermudian dollar and was replaced in 2012 by the white-tailed tropicbird, the tropicbird that can be found in Bermuda.  ",1
990,Accurate assessment of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult due to the remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of the sea where they might be found.  ,1
991,This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the IUCN. ,0
992,"This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. ",0
993,"The range of this species is believed to be 86.3 million square kilometers (33.3 million sq mi), with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals.  In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs.  ",1
994,"The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species,  such as rats. ",1
995,"It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. ",0
996,These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline.  ,1
997,"This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low.  ",1
998," Feral cats are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island Saba. ",0
999,"The eggs and chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both brown and black rats in places like Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are invasive species. ",1
1000,"On Ascension Island, the effect of the eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year.  ",1
1001,"Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, can be found in this bird. ",0
1002,"On the GalaÌpagos Islands, the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) occasionally eats young birds.  ",1
1003,"Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions.  Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, can be caused by pollutants.  ",1
1004,"About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years.  ",1
1005,"Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds.  Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. ",1
1006,"The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year.  ",1
1007,The red-capped parrot (Purpureicephalus spurius) is a species of broad-tailed parrot native to southwest Western Australia. ,0
1008,"It was described by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820, with no subspecies recognised. ",0
1009,"It has long been classified in its own genus owing to its distinctive elongated beak, though genetic analysis shows that it lies within the lineage of the Psephotellus parrots and that its closest relative is the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius). ",0
1010,"Not easily confused with other parrot species, it has a bright crimson crown, green-yellow cheeks, and a distinctive long bill. ",0
1011,"The wings, back, and long tail are dark green, and the underparts are purple-blue. ",0
1012,The adult female is very similar though sometimes slightly duller than the male; her key distinguishing feature is a white stripe on the wing under-surface. ,0
1013,"Found in woodland and open savanna country, the red-capped parrot is predominantly herbivorous, consuming seeds, particularly of eucalypts, as well as flowers and berries, but insects are occasionally eaten. ",0
1014,"Nesting takes place in tree hollows, generally of older large trees. ",0
1015,"Although the red-capped parrot has been shot as a pest and has been affected by land clearing, the population is growing and the species is considered of least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ",0
1016,It has a reputation of being anxious and difficult to breed in captivity. ,0
1017,"The red-capped parrot was first described in 1820 by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl as Psittacus spurius,  from an immature specimen collected in Albany, Western Australia on the Baudin expedition (1801â1803) and housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.   ",1
1018,"The specific epithet spurius is the Latin adjective meaning ""illegitimate"", and refers to the markedly different adult and immature plumages (hence appearing unrelated).  ",1
1019,"Irish naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors named the species Platycercus pileatus in 1830 from an adult male specimen that had been acquired by the Zoological Society of London.   English artist Edward Lear illustrated the live specimen in his 1830 work Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots.   ",1
1020,It was placed in the monotypic genus Purpureicephalusâas P. pileatusâby French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854.  ,1
1021,"The generic name is an amalgam of the Latin purpureus ""purple"", and the Ancient Greek kephaleÌ""head"".   ",1
1022,"In this generic combination, the current name is translated as ""bastard red-head"".  ",1
1023,"The species name pileatus was generally used until German naturalist Otto Finsch followed Kuhl in using the specific name spurius, calling it Platycercus spurius in 1868. ",0
1024,"His countryman Anton Reichenow classified Purpureicephalus as a subgenus of Platycercus before placing it in the genus Porphyreicephalus (later corrected to Porphyrocephalus), until 1912, when Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews re-established the genus as Purpureicephalus.  ",1
1025,The red-capped parrot's elongated bill and its unusual colorationâlack of cheek patches compared with Platycercusâare the main reasons for its placement in its own genus.  ,1
1026,No subspecies are recognised currently.  Mathews tentatively described a subspecies carteri in 1915 from a specimen collected at Broomehill on the basis of darker upperparts and greener cheeks;  it was not considered distinct by later authors.  ,1
1027,"There is no known geographical variation; five birds from Esperance had smaller bills and tarsi than individuals from elsewhere in its range, but the sample was too small to draw any conclusions.  ",1
1028,"The red-capped parrot is related to other broad-tailed parrots, but relationships within the group had been unclear.  ",1
1029,"In 1938, Australian ornithologist Dominic Serventy proposed that it was the sole survivor of a lineage of eastern Australian origin, with no close living relatives.  ",1
1030,"In 1955, British evolutionary biologist Arthur Cain proposed that the eastern lineage had vanished after being outcompeted by the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), and that its closest relative was the horned parakeet (Eunymphicus cornutus) of New Caledonia, which he concluded had adopted a much greener plumage of a wetter climate.  ",1
1031,"A 2011 genetic study including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA found that the red-capped parrot was closely related to the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius), the two lineages having diverged in the Miocene. ",0
1032,"English ornithologist John Gould used the name ""red-capped parakeet"" in 1848 based on Vigors' scientific name,  which also inspired the old avicultural term ""pileated parrot"". ",1
1033," ""Red-capped parrot"" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ",1
1034,The combined lineage itself diverging from one giving rise to the hooded parrot (Psephotellus dissimilis) and golden-shouldered parrot (Psephotellus chrysopterygius). ,1
1035,"It has also been called ""western king parrot"" to distinguish it from the Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis) occurring in the east, ""purple-crowned parrot"", ""grey parrot"", or ""hookbill"" for the distinctive upper mandible.  ",1
1036,"The name ""pileated parakeet"" potentially causes confusion among aviarists with the South American pileated parrot (Pionopsitta pileata). ",1
1037,"The name ""king parrot"" has persisted in Western Australia, English naturalist W. B. Alexander commenting that it was always known by this name in a field note in 1917,  ",1
1038,"Names in the Nyungar language, spoken by people of the southwest region, have been recorded at: Perth, Djar-rail-bur-tong and Djarrybarldung; King George Sound, Jul-u-up; Stirling Range, Chelyup; and Southwest, Djalyup.  ",1

The red-capped parrot has a long bill and bright, clear patterned plumage, variously described as magnificent, gaudy, or clownishly coloured.     ",1
1040,"Measuring 34â38 cm (13.5â15 in) in length with a 42â48 cm (16.5â19 in) wingspan, and weighing 105â125 g (3.7â4.4 oz), the adult red-capped parrot is a distinctive and easily recognised medium-sized parrot. ",0
1041,"The adult male has a crimson forehead and crown, which extends from the gape or base of the lower mandible through the eye and grey-brown lores. ",0
1042,"Its hindneck and cheeks are green, and its ear coverts are more yellow-green. ",0
1043,"In March and April, the crown feathers and ear coverts of birds with new plumage can have fine black edging. ",0
1044,"The feathers of the head, back and underparts, have grey bases that are generally hidden.  ",1
1045,"The upperparts, including the wings, are dark green, the rump yellow-green, and the tail is green with a dark blue tip.  ",1
1046,"The underparts are purplish-blue, the flanks green and red,  and the iris dark brown with a dark grey eye ring. ",1
1047,"The bill is pale blue-grey with a dark grey tip,  its upper mandible elongated to a slender hook.  ",1
1048,"The colouring of the female is similar to, though slightly duller than that of the male; the red of its plumage is not as intense and its red flanks are spotted with some green and yellow.  ",1
1049,Its breast is a more greyish shade of violet than purple.  ,1
1050,"In flight, it has a whitish stripe visible on the underside of the wing.  Female birds have white spots on seven or more underwing feathers,  although a few of both sexes lack spots entirely. ",1
1051,Birds with white spots on fewer than seven wing feathers can be either female or subadult male. ,0
1052,"The male has a slightly wider and flatter head, noticeable when birds are compared directly with each other,  as well as longer wings and tail. ",1
1053,Adult moulting takes place in the Southern Hemisphere summer and autumn.  ,1
1054,The red-capped parrot perches and walks with a distinctive upright posture.  ,1
1055,"Juveniles have greenish plumage overall, before beginning their first moult around August.  ",1
1056,Their subsequent plumage much more closely resembles that of adult birds.  ,1
1057,"The faintly seen markings of the adult pattern begin as a dark green crown, with a reddish frontal band, the grey-violet of the female breast, and red underparts mottled green.  ",1
1058,"The bill is more orange, but turns the pale blue-grey of adult birds by two to five months of age.  ",1
1059,"Juvenile birds with white spots on ten or fewer feathers on the wing undersurface are male, while those with more cannot be sexed. ",0
1060,Male subadults often have residual white spots on their wing feathers.  ,1
1061,"The rapidly repeated contact call has been transcribed as krukk-rak or crrr-uk, while the alarm call consists of a series of high-pitched loud notes.  ",1
1062,Nestlings and fledglings up to two weeks post leaving the nest make a high-pitched two-syllable food begging ,0
1063,"Male birds chatter loudly when agitated or marking their nest territory, but, unlike rosellas, not while feeding.  ",1
1064,"The red-capped parrot occurs in the Southwest Australia ecoregion in dense to open forest and woodland, and heathland in coastal regions. ",0
1065,The distribution range is south from Moore River to the coast to Esperance.  ,1
1066,"Records of the species extend inland from the southern coast, as far as Gingin and Mooliabeenee.  ",1
1067,"Within its range, it is sedentary in areas of higher rainfall, and locally nomadic in dryer areas.  ",1
1068,"The red-capped parrot mostly occurs within 100 km (60 mi) of the coastline, becoming sparser further inland.  ",1
1069,"The usual habitat is eucalypt forest or woodlands, but its distribution is mostly associated with marri (Corymbia calophylla). ",0
1070,This tree species provides a constant food source and has increased in range and population since the settlement of Europeans.  ,1
1071,"The parrot can be found in vegetation dominated by other tree species such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), tuart (E. gomphocephala), wandoo (E. wandoo), yate (E. cornuta), and peppermint (Agonis flexuosa).  ",1
1072,"A seed-eating bird, it is encountered in farmland, orchards, and suburban landscapes in Perth.   ",1
1073,It also occurs around remnant stands of marri conserved as shade trees on farmland in the western Wheatbelt and Swan Coastal Plain.  ,1
1074,It can be adversely impacted by land clearing and removal of trees. ,0
1075,The red-capped parrot uses large trees to roost in at night and retire to during the middle of the day. ,0
1076,"The parrot is frequently observed at lake reserves in suburban areas on the Swan Coastal Plain, within sight of waders (Charadriiformes) occurring at freshwater to brackish wetlands. ",0
1077,"It is common at the Forrestdale and Thomsons Lakes Ramsar Site, Bibra Lake,  and the Benger Swamp wetland, a region rich in avian species. ",1
1078,"It is also found at the Dryandra Woodland, another species-rich reserve with the stands of jarrah and marri over sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana) and dryandra (Banksia ser. ",0
1079,Red-cap parrot is commonly sighted at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and along roadsides around the Stirling Range and Porongorups.  ,1
1080,"The parrots are found in pairs or small groups of 4 to 6 individuals,  or occasionally in larger flocks of 20â30 birds. ",1
1081, Birds may associate with Australian ringneck parrots (Barnardius zonarius) or western rosellas (Platycercus icterotis).  ,1
1082,Rarely a flock of up to 100 birds may be encountered; these are generally composed of juveniles. ,1
1083,"The red-capped parrot is shy, and often retreats to the upper canopy of trees if disturbed,  which has made study of its breeding and social behaviour difficult. ",1
1084,"The red-capped parrot is thought to be monogamous, pairs forming long-term bonds generally from around 20 months of age. ",0
1085,"Younger females have been recorded pairing with older males at 8 or 9 months old, but do not appear able to breed at this age.  ",1
1086,"The male initiates courtship by following the female and making a contact call, as well as performing a courtship display. ",0
1087,"This involves it raising its crown feathers, ruffling its crown and rump feathers, lowering its wings to display its rump, and raising and flaring its tail feathers. ",0
1088,The female often stoops low and gives out a food-begging call. ,0
1089,These displays begin before a nest site is chosen and continue through the breeding season until around two weeks after the young have fledged.  ,1
1090,The red-capped parrot needs mature trees large enough to have hollows in the trunk or branches. ,0
1091,"These trees can be on road verges, along water courses, or in paddocks, as well as forest or woodland.  ",1
1092,"Nests are generally 50â100 m (150â350 ft) apart, and pairs defend them vigorously from other birds, particularly other red-capped parrots, for the duration of nesting.  ",1
1093,"The nest site is a tree hollow generally in an older large tree, such as a marri, jarrah, tuart, flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis) or paperbark (Melaleuca spp.), at a height between 4.5 and 16 metres (15 and 52 ft),   averaging around 9.6 m (31 ft) above the ground and often north or east-facing.  ",1
1094,"A lower entrance, narrow with a larger hollow, recorded at 3 metres (10 ft) was considered exceptional.  ",1
1095,"There are often chew marks at the entrance,  which is 70â170 millimetres (2.8â6.7 in) wide. ",1
1096,The hollow is 190 and 976 mm (7.5 and 38.4 in) deep and is lined with wood dust at the bottom.  ,1
1097,"The female incubates her clutch of usually five, occasionally six (records up to nine), milk-white eggs.  ",1
1098,The size of each almost spherical egg is 28 mm Ã 22 mm (1.10 in Ã 0.87 in).  ,1
1099,"The male attends her from a nearby tree, signalling to leave the nest for food he has brought.[24 ",0
1100,"] Information on the incubation period is limited, but is between 20 and 24 days.  ",1
1101,"The nestlings are nidicolousâthey remain in the nest initially, weighing 4â6 ",0
1102,"(0.14â0.21 oz) at birth and gaining, on average, 4.1 g (0.14 oz) a day.  ",1
1103,"At birth they are covered in white down, which is soon replaced by grey down.  ",1
1104,"Their eyes open by 9â11 days of age, and primary quills appear by 9â15 days and primary feathers proper by 14â20 days. ",0
1105,"They are fed by the female alone for the first two weeks, then by both parents. ",0
1106,"They fledge between 30 and 37 days, generally all leaving the nest on the same day. ",0
1107,"Marri seeds are the preferred diet, but it also extracts seeds from karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), woody pear (Xylomelum), Grevillea, Hakea, dryandra (Banksia) and sheoak (Casuarina, Allocasuarina), mangite (Banksia grandis), as well as from grasses, herbs, or shrubs associated with marri-dominated vegetation types.     ",1
1108,"The beak of this parrot allows more precision to obtain seeds from a eucalypt's capsule, the tough case of marri is chewed through by the ringneck parrot or cleaved by the powerful beak of cockatoos (Cacatuidae species).  ",1
1109," Records of feeding on acacia seed pods include Acacia celastrifolia, A. dentifera, A. oncinophylla and A. restiacea, which occur in its range, and stripping pods for small seed of cultivated Acacia merinthophora. ",0
1110,A grass speciesâwild oats (Avena fatua)âand acacia are grazed for green seed. ,1
1111,"The nectar filled  blooms of kangaroo paws (Anigozanthos sp.) are also sought out, although, unlike the honeyeater and spinebill, their weight breaks the long stalk when feeding.  ",1
1112,Any viable seed that is consumed may be undigested and dispersed.  ,1
1113,"Although the red-capped parrot eats fewer introduced plant species than other parrots, it does eat the seeds of slender thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), sheep thistle (C. tenuiflorus), and variegated thistle (Silybum marianum).  ",1
1114,The species has also adapted to exploit the introduction of orchard fruit such as apples and pears and the gardens of suburban areas.   ,1
1115,"The red-capped parrot bites predominantly red-skinned apples, attempting to retrieve the seed from inside. ",0
1116,It does not eat the flesh but instead squeezes it to drink the juice.  ,1
1117,"The fruit of other cultivated introductions are also selected, including almond, nectarine, olive, peaches, plums, pomegranates, and white cedar (Melia azedarach). ",0
1118,"Insect larvae and lerp are also consumed,  particularly in late winter and spring during its breeding season.  ",1
1119,"The red-capped parrot primarily feeds on the ground, clasping the capsule of eucalypts or cones of sheoak with one foot and extracting the seed with their slender hooked beak.  ",1
1120,The dexterity it exhibits using its foot and beak to dislodge seeds is also shown by the long-billed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii). ,0
1121,"The two occur in the same habitat, both specialising in extracting the marri's store of large seeds.  ",1
1122,"Both species prise marri seeds out of their woody capsule by manipulating it with the foot and lower mandible, and inserting the point of the upper mandible at openings in the seed-dispersing valve.  ",1
1123,The marks left by the lower mandible on the marri's nut distinguish it from those fed on by other parrots and cockatoos.  ,1
1124,"The red-capped parrot leaves shallow marks around the opening of the capsule, with little damage to the husk.  ",1
1125,"The species mainly feeds and manipulates objects with its left foot; limited sampling of Australian parrot species indicates that laterality is associated with larger size, and many of these are left-footed, though two other broad-tailed parrot species (crimson rosella and Australian ringneck) are right-footed, and smaller species show no preference.  ",1
1126,"A parasitic protozoan, Eimeria purpureicephali, was isolated and described from a diseased bird in 2016. ",0
1127,"Species of bird louse recorded on the red-capped parrot include Forficuloecus palmai, Heteromenopon kalamundae and a member of the genus Neopsittaconirmus.  Psittacine beak and feather disease virus was isolated and sequenced from a fledgling in 2016.  ",1
1128,It is an intracellular parasite that lives in the host's gastrointestinal system.  ,1
1129,"Due to damage to orchard crops, these birds have been classified and shot as pests,  although 1985 fieldwork in orchards around Balingup showed that the damage they inflicted was insignificant.  Local government acts in the agricultural districts of Collie and West Arthur proclaimed them vermin in 1943.  ",1
1130,"Despite this, its population is growing, possibly due to existing areas being degraded to a more favourable habitat. ",0
1131,"On account of this and its large range, it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),  though it has declined in the shires north of Perth as marri forests have vanished with urban development.  ",1
1132,"Like most species of parrots, the red-capped parrot is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.  ",1
1133,"Its attractive colours make the red-capped parrot a desirable species to keep, although it has a reputation for being anxious in captivity and difficult to breed. ",0
1134,"This may be because of historically high proportion of wild-caught birds entering aviculture. The first record of successful reproduction in captivity was in England, almost simultaneously by two aviculturalists in 1909, the slightly earlier hatching of one brood saw Mr. Astley awarded a medal by the nation's Avicultural Society.[57 ",1
1135,The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) is a small passerine bird native to Australia. ,0
1136,"Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. ",0
1137,"Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. ",0
1138,"Measuring 10.5â12.5 cm (4.1â4.9 in) in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. ",0
1139,"The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. ",0
1140,"This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. ",0
1141,"Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied. ",0
1142,"The position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to European or American robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the songbird infraorder Passerida. ",0
1143,"The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of insects and spiders. ",0
1144,"Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity. ",0
1145,"The red-capped robin was described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, having been collected in the northern Spencer Gulf in South Australia. ",0
1146,"They named it Muscicapa goodenovii,  and placed it among the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.  ",1
1147,"The specific epithet goodenovii honours the Reverend Samuel Goodenough, Bishop of Carlisle and first treasurer of the Linnean Society.  ",1
1148,"The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words petros 'rock' and oikos 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.  ",1
1149,"Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as ""red robins"", as distinct from the ""yellow robins"" of the genus Eopsaltria. ",0
1150,"It is not closely related to the American robin or the European robin; however, it is named after the European robin.  Molecular research (and current consensus) places the red-capped robin and its relativesâthe Australian robin family Petroicidaeâas a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or ""advanced"" songbirds, within the songbird lineage.  ",1
1151,"No subspecies are recognised, and the only geographic variation recorded in plumage is a tendency for females from more arid regions to have paler plumage.  ",1
1152,"Officially known as the red-capped robin, it has also been referred to as redhead,  redcap, robin red-breast or red-throated robin.  ",1
1153,Testing of the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of Australian members of the genus Petroica suggests that the red-capped robin's closest relative within the genus is the scarlet robin.  ,1
1154,"Across southwestern Australia, it was known as menekedang by the local indigenous people.  ",1
1155,"In the Arandic languages spoken in Central Australia, the red-capped robin is known as ak-arl-atwe-rre-ye meaning ""the head that they hit"" from an ancient myth of it being hit on the head and bleeding.  ",1
1156,"The smallest of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5â12.5 cm (4.1â4.9 in) long with a wingspan of 15â19.5 cm (5.9â7.7 in), and weighs around 7â9 g (0.25â0.31 oz). ",0
1157,It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. ,0
1158,"Its upperparts are jet-black with white shoulder bars, and its tail is black with white tips. ",0
1159,"The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing-patch. ",0
1160,"Both sexes have a small, black bill,  and dark brown eyes and legs. ",1
1161,"Immature birds initially resemble the female;  it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around a year of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage.  ",1
1162,"Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, canthaxanthin and adonirubin, are responsible for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage.  ",1
1163,"The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season, which takes place between December and April.  ",1
1164,"The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. ",0
1165,"Carotenoids are costly to metabolise, and are also required for use in immune function, hence red-capped robins need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. ",0
1166,"A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males, which had greater reproductive success and were in better condition, moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. ",0
1167,"However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season.  ",1
1168,"Adult males can breed at one year of age, and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage,  but they are less successful at reproducing at this age.  ",1
1169,"The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.  ",1
1170,"A variety of calls have been recorded, described as 'tinkle' and 'blurt' songs. ",0
1171,"These are similar across mainland Australia but distinct on Rottnest Island; on the isolated island, birds rarely linked successive songs.  ",1
1172,"This species may be confused with the related flame robin (P. phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P. boodang), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts.  Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter ",1
1173,"The red-capped robin is found across Australia, except for Tasmania, Cape York, the Top End, and most of the Kimberley (there have been occasional sightings in the southernmost parts). ",0
1174,"Offshore populations exist on Rottnest Island, as well as Greenly and Pearson Islands off the Eyre Peninsula,  but it is not found on Kangaroo Island. ",1
1175,"Although widespread, it is uncommon in many areas; it is rare east of the Great Dividing Range, in coastal regions in the south of the continent, and in the northern parts of its rangeâit is seldom encountered north of 20Â°S.  ",1
1176,"Its movements are generally poorly known,  particularly outside the breeding season.  ",1
1177,"It is sedentary in much of the southern parts of its range, although the red-capped robin is a spring and summer visitor to the Nullarbor Plain and Adelaide region in South Australia, and central Victoria. ",0
1178,It is a winter visitor in the northern parts of its range.  ,1
1179,"The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat than its relatives, and inhabits drier areas, while the scarlet robin occupies wetter forests, where they co-occur.  ",1
1180,"The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry Acacia, Callitris, or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (Acacia aneura), Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae), raspberry jam (Acacia acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs, such as Cassinia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila), and spinifex (Triodia).  ",1
1181,The species has generally fared badly with human change to the landscape. ,0
1182,"Once common on the Cumberland Plain in Sydney's western suburbs, it has now almost disappeared from the Sydney Basin.  ",1
1183,"It has also disappeared from the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.  ",1
1184,Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.  ,1
1185,"The feral cat is known to prey on the red-capped robin, and several bird species, including the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus), and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) raid nests and take young.  ",1
1186,There is one record of a brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg.  ,1
1187,"The red-capped robin is generally encountered alone or in pairs,  although groups of up to eight birdsâa mated pair and their youngâmay be seen in autumn and winter.  ",1
1188,"The species may join mixed-species flocks with other small insectivorous passerines; species recorded include the willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris) and black-faced woodswallow (Artamus cinereus) in Queensland,  and the chestnut-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza uropygialis), buff-rumped thornbill (A. reguloides) or inland thornbill (A. apicalis) in Western Australia.  ",1
1189,"The red-capped robin typically perches in a prominent location low to the ground, often flicking its wings and tail. ",0
1190,It is very active and does not stay still for long.  ,1
1191,"The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.  ",1
1192,The red-capped robin is territorial during the breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2 ha (0.6â3 acres).  ,1
1193,A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn.  ,1
1194,"The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion.  ",1
1195,"Two males have been seen to face one another 30 to 1 m (98.4 to 3.3 ft) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display, while the female is incubating her eggs.  ",1
1196,"Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been 36 km (22 mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower National Park in northern Victoria.  ",1
1197,"The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories.  ",1
1198,The breeding season takes place over five months from August to January with up to three broods raised. ,0
1199,"The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. ",0
1200,"He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone.  ",1
1201,"The nest is a neat, deep cup, made of soft dry grass and bark. ",0
1202,"Spider webs, feathers, and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork, or sometimes a mistletoe bush.  ",1
1203,"Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish, and splotched with dark grey-brown, are laid on consecutive days, with each egg measuring 16 mm Ã 13 mm (0.63 in Ã 0.51 in).   ",1
1204,It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings.  ,1
1205,"Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young.  ",1
1206,"The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood, while the female is foraging; and both parents will feed young and dart off quickly, if there are predators in the vicinity.  Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and there is some evidence that extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.  ",1
1207,"Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and covered only by a thin layer of down. ",0
1208,"By seven days, they are stretching wings and preening, and at two weeks they are able to fly.  ",1
1209,"Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest,  and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects, such as flies and moths.  ",1
1210,Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood.  ,1
1211,"In a field study near Cooma, in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single-brood year; and fledglings dispersed in less than a week from the territory of a pair that raised two broods in the season.  ",1
1212,The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. ,0
1213,"Despite this, on average, only two young are successfully fledged per year.  ",1
1214,"The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C. osculans) have been recorded as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own.   Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.  ",1
1215,"One study of red-capped robin faeces conducted near Kambalda, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet was made up of beetles, while ants made up the remainder.  ",1
1216,"Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers, including the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), adult and larval butterflies and moths, including geometer moths, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, antlions, true bugs, including chinch bugs of the family Lygaeidae and shield bugs, various types of beetles, earwigs, and flies such as blow-flies and horse-flies.   ",1
1217,"The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, although it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. ",0
1218,"Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3 m (9.8 ft) above the ground.  ",1
1219,"The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken.  ",1
1220,"  The red-headed myzomela or red-headed honeyeater (Myzomela erythrocephala) is a passerine bird of the honeyeater family Meliphagidae found in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. ",0
1221,A low branch may be used as a vantage point in hunting.  ,1
1222,"Two subspecies are recognised, with the nominate race M. e. erythrocephala distributed around the tropical coastline of Australia, and M. e. infuscata in New Guinea. ",0
1223,"While the IUCN lists the Australian population of M. e. infuscata as being near threatened, as a whole the widespread range means that its conservation is of least concern. ",0
1224,"At 12 cm (4.7 in), it is a small honeyeater with a short tail and relatively long down-curved bill. ",0
1225,It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. ,0
1226,"It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. ",0
1227,"While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches. ",0
1228,"The red-headed myzomela was described and named as Myzomela erythrocephala by John Gould in 1840,  from specimens collected in King Sound in northern Western Australia.  ",1
1229,"The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words myzo  'to suckle' and meli 'honey', and refers to the bird's nectarivorous habits, while erythrocephala is from the Greek erythros 'red' and -kephale 'head'.  ",1
1230,"This species was known as the red-headed honeyeater in Australia, and red-headed myzomela elsewhere,  the latter name being adopted as the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).  ",1
1231,"Other common names are mangrove red-headed honeyeater, mangrove redhead, and blood-bird.  ",1
1232,"Two subspecies are recognised:  the nominate race M. e. erythrocephala, and M.  e. infuscata, which was described by  William Alexander Forbes in 1879 from a specimen collected from Hall Bay in southern New Guinea. ",1
1233,"Forbes noted there was more red on the back, and the upperparts are a lighter brown.  ",1
1234,"The Sumba myzomela (Myzomela dammermani) was until 2008 regarded as a subspecies of the red-headed myzomela,  as was the crimson-hooded myzomela (M. kuehni), which is endemic to the Indonesian island of Wetar.  ",1
1235,"The red-headed myzomela is a member of the genus Myzomela which includes two other Australian species, the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia, and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia. ",0
1236,"A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal myzomelas, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed.  ",1
1237,"A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the red-headed myzomela diverged from that of the black-breasted myzomela around 4 million years ago; however, the relationships of many species within the genus are uncertain.  ",1
1238,"Molecular analysis has shown that honeyeaters are related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.  ",1
1239,"Because the red-headed myzomela occurs on many offshore islands and appears to be an effective water-crosser, it has been hypothesised that north-western Australia was the primary centre of origin for the two subspecies.  ",1
1240,"The red-headed myzomela is a distinctive small honeyeater with a compact body, short tail and relatively long down-curved bill. ",0
1241,"It averages 12 centimetres (4.7 in), with a wingspan of 17â19 cm (6.7â7.5 in) and a weight of 8 grams (0.28 oz). ",0
1242,"The birds exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males being slightly larger and much more brightly coloured than females.  ",1
1243,"The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. ",0
1244,"The rest of the upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. ",0
1245,"The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. ",0
1246,"The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. ",0
1247,There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. ,0
1248,The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. ,0
1249,The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. ,0
1250,"One study suggested a connection between the female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood ",0
1251,Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible.  ,1
1252,"Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age.  ",1
1253,The red-headed myzomela has a range of contact calls and songs that are primarily metallic or scratchy.  ,1
1254,"M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.  ",1
1255,"Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour.  ",1
1256,Its song is an abrupt tchwip-tchwip-tchwip-tchwip with a slightly softer swip-swip-swip-swip contact call and a scolding charrk-charrk.  ,1
1257,"The red-headed myzomela closely resembles the scarlet myzomela, though there is only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. ",0
1258,"The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill.  ",1
1259,The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.  ,1
1260,"The nominate subspecies of the red-headed myzomela is distributed across the tropical coastlines of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. ",0
1261,"It inhabits coastal areas of the Kimberley and various offshore islands in Western Australia, and is similarly distributed in the Northern Territory, including Melville Island and the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands. ",0
1262,It is widespread around the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Cape York Peninsula.  ,1
1263,"M. e. infuscata occurs at scattered sites in West Papua and in south Papua New Guinea, from the Mimika Regency in the west to the Fly River in the east, and the Aru Islands.  ",1
1264,Some birds of Cape York have features intermediate between the two subspecies.  ,1
1265,"Although the red-headed myzomela is widely distributed, it is not abundant within its range. ",0
1266,The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. ,0
1267,The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the flowering of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).  ,1
1268,"Population numbers have been reported as fluctuating in some areas with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred mangrove and Melaleuca food trees, and there is some indication that the birds can travel more widely.  ",1
1269,"The species' movements are poorly understood, variously described as resident, nomadic or migratory.  ",1
1270,"A single bird was recaptured after being banded nearly five years earlier, 27 kilometres (17 mi) from the original banding site, and the species' occupation of a large number of offshore islands suggests that the red-headed myzomela is effective at crossing distances over water.  ",1
1271,The maximum age recorded from banding has been 7 years 1.5 months.  ,1
1272,"The red-headed myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but it often also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves such as those of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra).  ",1
1273,"It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared.  ",1
1274,"The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year.  ",1
1275,"In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat.  ",1
1276,"Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.  ",1
1277,"The red-headed myzomela is occasionally found in swampy woodlands, casuarina woodlands and open forest, particularly those with Pandanus and paperbarks, as well as on coconut farms.  ",1
1278,"While the social organisation of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, it is reported as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it has been described as forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye.  ",1
1279,"It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. ",0
1280,"It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.  ",1
1281,"The red-headed myzomela actively defends food trees, engaging in aggressive bill-wiping both in response to a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. ",0
1282,It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to the ground before disengaging. ,0
1283,"It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.  ",1
1284,"There are few scientific reports on the breeding behaviour of the red-headed myzomela, and little detail is available on the breeding season.  ",1
1285,A study of populations in the western Kimberley reported that the birds hold territories through much of the dry season and then disperse.  ,1
1286,"The nest is built in the foliage of the mangroves, suspended by a rim from a small horizontal fork about 6â10 m (20â33 ft) above the ground or water. ",0
1287,"The nest is small and cup-shaped, and built from small pieces of bark, leaves, plant fibre and sometimes seaweed, bound together with spider web and lined with finer material. ",0
1288,"It is, on average, 5.4 cm (2.1 in) in diameter and 3.7 cm (1.5 in) deep.  ",1
1289,"Measuring 16 by 12 mm (0.63 by 0.47 in), the eggs are oval, smooth and lustreless white, with small spots or blotches of red on the larger end. ",0
1290,The clutch size is reported to be two or three eggs.  ,1
1291,"While there is no reliable information on incubation and feeding, it is believed that both parents are active in caring for the young.  ",1
1292,"A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone incubated eggs.  ",1
1293,"The red-headed myzomela is arboreal, feeding at flowers and among the outer foliage in the crowns of mangroves and other flowering trees.  Very active when feeding, it darts from flower to flower, probing for nectar with its long curved bill. ",1
1294,"It gleans insects from foliage and twigs, as well as sallying for flying insects. ",0
1295,"Typical invertebrates eaten include spiders and insects such as beetles, bugs, wasps, and caterpillars.  ",1
1296,"The red-headed myzomela predominately feeds on mangrove species, and in north-western Australia is the major pollinator of the rib-fruited mangrove (Bruguiera exaristata).  ",1
1297,"However, it also feeds in paperbarks and other coastal forests and has been recorded feeding in cultivated bottlebrush and Grevillea in Darwin gardens, and silver-leaf grevillea (Grevillea refracta) and green birdflower (Crotalaria cunninghamii) in northwest Western Australia. ",0
1298,The red-headed myzomela may travel some distance from roosting areas to feed on plants in flower.  ,1
1299,"M. e. erythrocephala is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN,  because the population is widespread. ",1
1300,"However, the Australian population of M. e. infuscata is listed as near threatened, since it is confined to three small islands with a combined area of about 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi).  ",1
1301,"There is no immediate threat to the red-headed myzomela, except the risk posed to low islands by rising sea levels;  however, it has been recommended that community-based ecotourism on the tropical coast be promoted, as it could lead to monitoring of sub-populations and habitat by visiting birdwatchers and local rangers.[26 Podiceps griseigena (Lapsus) The red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. ",1
1302,"Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. ",0
1303,"Grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites. ",0
1304,"During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. ",0
1305,It also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls. ,0
1306,"Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog. ",0
1307,"Like all grebes, the Red-necked is a good swimmer, a particularly swift diver, and responds to danger by diving rather than flying. ",0
1308,"The feet are positioned far back on the body, near the tail, which makes the bird ungainly on land. ",0
1309,"It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. ",0
1310,"The conservation status of its two subspeciesâP. g. grisegena found in Europe and western Asia, and the larger P. g. holboelii (formerly HolbÅll grebe), in North America and eastern Siberiaâis evaluated as Least Concern, and the global population is stable or growing. ",0
1311,"The red-necked grebe was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in  1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux.  ",1
1312,The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by FrancÌ§ois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches EnlumineÌes D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  ,1
1313,The red-necked grebe is now placed in the genus Podiceps that was erected by the English naturalist John Latham in 1787.   ,1
1314,"The genus name Podiceps comes from Latin podicis, ""vent"" or ""anus"", and pes, ""foot"", and is a reference to the placement of a grebe's legs towards the rear of its body.  ",1
1315,The species name grisegena is from Latin griseus (grey) and gena (cheek) and refers to the face pattern of the breeding adult.  ,1
1316,"Grebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed, rather than webbed, toes. ",0
1317,"There are several genera, of which the most widespread is Podiceps with nine species, one recently extinct. ",0
1318,Fossils of the species dating to the middle Pleistocene have been found in Italy.  ,1
1319,The red-necked grebe's closest relative is the fish-eating great crested grebe of Europe and western Asia.  ,1
1320,"It is possible that the red-necked grebe originally evolved in North America and later spread to Europe, where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin.  ",1
1321,"The red-necked grebe has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies P. g. grisegena in Europe and western Asia, and P. g. holboelii (Holboell's grebe, named for Danish explorer of Greenlandic birds Carl Peter HolbÃ ̧ll) in North America and eastern Siberia. ",0
1322,"The east Asian birds have slightly smaller bills than the American form, although the differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies.  ",1
1323,"The red-necked grebe is a medium-large grebe, smaller than the great crested grebe of Eurasia, and the western and Clark's grebes of North America.   ",1
1324,"The adult of the nominate European subspecies is 40â50 cm (16â20 in) long with a 77â85 cm (30â33 in) average wingspan,  and weighs 692â925 g (24.4â32.6 oz).  ",1
1325,"In breeding plumage, it has a black cap that extends below the eye, very pale grey cheeks and throat, a rusty red neck, dark grey back and flanks, and white underparts. ",0
1326,"The eyes are dark brown and the long, pointed bill is black with a yellow base.  ",1
1327,"The winter plumage of the red-necked grebe is duskier than that of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale crescent that curves around the rear of the face contrasts with the rest of the head. ",0
1328,"The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer.  ",1
1329,"Although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. ",0
1330,"It is larger than the Slavonian (horned) grebe, with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face.  ",1
1331,"It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.  ",1
1332,"Chicks have a striped head and breast, and older juveniles have a striped face, diffuse blackish cap, pale red neck and extensive yellow on the bill.  ",1
1333,"The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male averages heavier than the female.  ",1
1334,The difference in size between the sexes is greater than for this subspecies that for P. g. grisegena.  ,1
1335,"The red-necked grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind the body, which gives it a stretched-out appearance.  ",1
1336,"The relatively small wings are grey with white secondaries, and beat very rapidly.  ",1
1337,"Its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land,  and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off.  ",1
1338,"Like all grebes, the red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater, and steers by rotating its legs, since its tail is too short for this purpose.  ",1
1339,"This is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season, but, like its relatives, it is mainly silent for the rest of the year. ",0
1340,"It has a loud, wailing or howling display call uooooh, given by a single bird or a pair in duet, by night or during the day, and often from cover. ",0
1341,Long sequences of up to 60 consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds. ,0
1342,"A great variety of quacking, clucking, hissing, rattling and purring calls are also given, with much individual variation.  ",1
1343,"Breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than 3 ha (7.4 acres) in extent and less than 2 m (6.6 ft) deep. ",0
1344,"The red-necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub tundra, and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation, such as reedbeds.  ",1
1345,"The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements.  ",1
1346,"The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.  ",1
1347,"All populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea, usually in estuaries and bays, but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands.  ",1
1348,"The preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than 15 m (49 ft) deep with a sand or gravel bottom, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed.  ",1
1349,"Migration is usually at night, but may occur during the day, especially when over water. ",0
1350,"During winter, birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks, but on migration, concentrations of over 2000 individuals may occur at favoured staging sites.  ",1
1351,"This is particularly noticeable in autumn on the Great Lakes, when up to 18,000 birds may pass Whitefish Point on Lake Superior; these are thought to be Canadian breeders heading for the Atlantic Ocean to winter. ",0
1352,"This easterly route is longer than that to the Pacific, but avoids the Rockies.  ",1
1353,"The breeding range of the red-necked grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. ",0
1354,"The red-necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. ",0
1355,"It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100 m (330 ft), although has nested at up to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) in Turkey.  ",1
1356,"The nominate subspecies breeds from southern Sweden and Denmark through central and eastern Europe east to western Siberia, and winters mainly in the North and Baltic Seas, with smaller numbers in the Adriatic, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean and on inland lakes.  ",1
1357,"P. g. holboelii breeds in North America in Alaska, western and central Canada, and the northern US east to Minnesota ; in Asia it nests in eastern Siberia from Kamchatka south to Hokkaido and west to Mongolia.",0
1358,"The Asian birds winter at sea from Japan to the East China Sea, and American breeders winter in the Pacific, mainly from southern Alaska to British Columbia (with smaller numbers south to California), and in the Atlantic from Newfoundland and Labrador to Florida. ",0
1359,Some birds remain on the Great Lakes if they are sufficiently ice-free.  ,1
1360,"Red-necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than 50 m (160 ft) between neighbouring nests, although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory. ",1
1361,"This species occurs as a rare winter vagrant in Afghanistan, Pakistan  and parts of northern and western India.     ",1
1362,"Semi-colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. ",0
1363,"Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods.  ",1
1364,"Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to 10 m (33 ft).  ",1
1365,"The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing-spreading, hunching, and bill-thrusting;  pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating.  ",1
1366,Breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds.  ,1
1367,"The monogamous pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water, and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences.  ",1
1368,"The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered ""cat"" display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a ""penguin"" dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.    ",1
1369,"Like all grebes, the red-necked grebe nests near water into which it can escape, since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land. ",0
1370,"The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation,  in water 0.5â0.75 m (20â30 in) deep, and with the bulk of nest below the water line. ",1
1371,"Egg-laying mainly takes place from mid-April to May in Europe,  and somewhat later, from mid-May to June, in North America.  ",1
1372,"Parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night, possibly to evade nocturnal predators. ",0
1373,"It is unclear whether this is for self-protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment, whatever the reason.  ",1
1374,"The red-necked grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average 3.4 cm (1.3 in) in breadth, 5.1 cm (2.0 in) in length, and weigh about 30.5 g (1.08 oz), of which 10% is shell. ",1
1375,"Parents take turns to incubate the eggs for 21â33 days until the precocial downy chicks hatch;  they immediately climb onto the parent's back, where they spend most of their time until they are 10â17 days old.   ",1
1376,"The young may be fed by the parents for up to 54 days after fledging,  and can fly at 50â70 days.  ",1
1377,The parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried. ,0
1378,"Later they care for the younger chicks for longer, and are aggressive with the older offspring. ",0
1379,"This equalises the post-fledging survival of all chicks, and encourages their independence.  ",1
1380,"The brood may be split, so that each parent feeds only some of the chicks. ",0
1381,After breeding the adults moult their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless; migration commences once the flight feathers have regrown.  ,1
1382,"Eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators, including the raccoon in North America and the carrion crow in Europe.   ",1
1383,"The red-necked grebe is normally single-brooded, although second broods and re-nesting after a clutch has been lost may extend nesting into July or August.  ",1
1384,"On average, for each adult, 0.65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month, although the mortality rate for the adult is unknown. ",0
1385,"Red-necked grebes attempt to evade birds of prey by diving; when feeding, dives average less than 30 seconds, although escape dives are more prolonged.  ",1
1386,"On the breeding grounds, the red-necked grebe feeds mainly on invertebrates including adult and larval aquatic insects, such as water beetles and dragonfly larvae, crayfish and molluscs. ",0
1387,"Fish (such as smelt ) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and crustaceans can constitute up to 20% of the grebe's diet. ",1
1388,Birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed.  ,1
1389,"Aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged, and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation.  ",1
1390,A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water. ,0
1391,"European breeders, which have to compete with the larger great crested grebe for fish, eat a greater proportion of invertebrates than the longer-billed American subspecies, although both races eat mainly fish in winter.  ",1
1392,The grebe probably opens its bill and looks down the eye-line toward its target. ,1
1393,"Birds of the nominate subspecies from the northernmost breeding populations in Finland and Russia, beyond the range of great crested grebe, have a longer and more slender bill than those further south, reflecting a greater proportion of fish in the diet where their main competitor is absent.  ",1
1394,"Like other grebes, the red-necked grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers, which remain in the bird's stomach. ",1
1395,"If food is scarce, parents may desert unhatched eggs, or allow the smallest chicks to starve, although the latter strategy appears not to be particularly efficient in protecting the older chicks.  ",1
1396," Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching. ",0
1397,"The function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown, although it has been suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard, indigestible material.  ",1
1398,"The red-necked grebe has a large range, estimated at 1â10 million square kilometres (0.4â3.8 million square miles), and a global population of 150,000â370,000 individuals,  with P. g. holboellii about twice as numerous as the nominate race.  ",1
1399,"The population trend has not been quantified, but it is not believed to meet the thresholds for the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. ",0
1400,The red-necked grebe is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.  ,1
1401,Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan. ,0
1402,"The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.  ",1
1403,"The Red-necked Grebe was hunted by humans in northern Europe in the Mesolithic and Paleolithic periods,    but there is no evidence that there is any significant level of hunting at the present time.   ",1
1404,"In North America, there are potential threats from pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides such as DDT which cause reduced reproductive success due to egg sterility and eggshell thinning. ",0
1405,Breeding areas may be threatened by the modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water-based recreational activities.  ,1
1406,"There is no evidence to suggest that these threats could result in a significant risk to the overall population; more than 70% of North American red-necked grebes breed in Canada, where the population is stable or increasing.[39 ",0
1407,"The red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii) also known as Banksian- or Banks' black cockatoo, is a large black cockatoo native to Australia. ",0
1408,Adult males have a characteristic pair of bright red panels on the tail that gives the species its name. ,0
1409,It is more common in the drier parts of the continent. ,0
1410,"Although the more northerly subspecies are widespread, the two southern subspecies, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo and the south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo are under threat. ",0
1411,"The species is usually found in eucalyptus woodlands, or along water courses. ",0
1412,"In the more northerly parts of the country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. ",0
1413,"They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. ",0
1414,Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. ,0
1415,"Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture,  although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.  ",1
1416,"The species complex was first described by the ornithologist John Latham in 1790 as Psittacus banksii,  commemorating English botanist Sir Joseph Banks. ",1
1417,"The red-tailed black cockatoo also has the distinction of being the first bird from Eastern Australia illustrated by a European, as a female, presumably collected at Endeavour River in north Queensland, was sketched by Banks' draughtsman Sydney Parkinson in 1770.  Narrowly predating Latham, English naturalist George Shaw described Psittacus magnificus from a specimen collected somewhere in the Port Jackson (now Sydney) region.  ",1
1418,"For many years, the species was referred to as Calyptorhynchus magnificus,  proposed by Gregory Mathews in 1927 as Shaw's name had predated Latham's 1790 description. ",1
1419,"For several decades, Mathews' proposal was accepted by many authorities, although it was unclear whether the original Port Jackson reference had actually referred to the red-tailed black or, more likely, the glossy black cockatoo. ",0
1420,"In 1994, an application to conserve Calyptorhynchus banksii as the scientific name was accepted by the ICZN.  ",1
1421,"The red-tailed black cockatoo is the type species of the genus Calyptorhynchus,  the name of which is derived from the Greek calypto-/ÎoÎ±Î»ÏÏÏÎ¿- ""hidden"" and rhynchus/ÏÏÎ3ÏÎ¿Ï ""beak"".  ",1
1422,The change was first made by Anselme GaeÌtan Desmarest in 1826.  ,1
1423,"In 1827, Jennings proposed the name Psittacus niger for the bird.  ",1
1424,"The binomial combination had already been used by Carl Linnaeus for the lesser vasa parrot in 1758,  and by Johann Friedrich Gmelin for the palm cockatoo in 1788; it was thus invalid even though both other species were already known by different names at the time. ",1
1425,"Alternate common names include Banks' black cockatoo, Banksian black cockatoo, or simply black cockatoo.  ",1
1426,Indigenous people of the central Cape York Peninsula have several names for the bird:  (minha) pachang in Pakanh; (inh -) inhulg in Uw Oykangand; and (inh -) anhulg in Uw Olkola. ,0
1427,(The bracketed prefix (inh- or minha) is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or ,0
1428,'animal'.)  Ngarnarrh or karnamarr are terms used by the Kunwinjku of Arnhem Land.   ,1
1429,"In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term for the subspecies ",0
1430,C. b. samueli is iranti.  Karrak is a Noongar term derived from the call for the southwestern race C. b. naso.  ,1
1431,In the language of the Bungandidj of south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria this bird was called treen.  ,1
1432,The red-tailed black cockatoo's closest relative is the glossy black cockatoo; the two species form the subgenus Calyptorhynchus within the genus of the same name.  ,1
1433,"They are distinguished from the other black cockatoos of the subgenus  Zanda by their significant sexual dimorphism and calls of the juveniles; one a squeaking begging call, the other a vocalization when swallowing food.   ",1
1434,"A 1999 mtDNA phylogenetic study of cockatoos utilizing among others, the red-tailed black cockatoo supported the hypotheses that cockatoos originated in Australia before the Paleogene and Neogene periods (66 mya, marking the end of the Mesozoic, to 2.6 mya) and that the genus Cacatua diversified in two separate radiations to the islands of Indonesia, New Guinea, and the South Pacific. ",0
1435,"A 2008 mitochondrial and nuclear DNA phylogenetic study of the parrots, cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of the ancestral parrots in the Cretaceous period, and an Australasia divergence of the ancestral cockatoos from the parrots in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.  ",1
1436,"It concluded that the first extant cockatoo to diverge from the ancestral cockatoos was the palm cockatoo, followed by a subclade containing the black cockatoos.  ",1
1437,"Five subspecies are recognised; they differ mainly in the size and shape of the beak, the overall bird size and female colouration:  Red-tailed black cockatoos are around 60 centimetres (24 in) in length and sexually dimorphic. ",1
1438,The male's plumage is all black with a prominent black crest made up of elongated feathers from the forehead and crown. ,0
1439,The tail is also black with two lateral bright red panels. ,0
1440,"Females are black with yellow-orange stripes in the tail and chest, and yellow grading to red spots on the cheeks and wings. ",0
1441,The underparts are barred with fine yellow over a black base. ,0
1442,"Male birds weigh between 670 and 920 grams (1.5â2 lb), while females weigh slightly less at 615â870 grams (1.25â1.75 lb).  ",1
1443,"In common with other cockatoos and parrots, red-tailed black cockatoos have zygodactyl feet, two toes facing forward and two backward, that allow them to grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation. ",0
1444,"Juvenile red-tailed black cockatoos resemble females until puberty, which occurs around four years of age, but have paler yellow barred underparts.  ",1
1445,Black cockatoos are almost exclusively left-footed (along with nearly all other cockatoos and most parrots).  ,1
1446,"As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.  ",1
1447,"As with other cockatoos, the red-tailed black cockatoo can be very long-lived in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist Neville Cayley reported one over fifty years old at Taronga Zoo.  ",1
1448,Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.  ,1
1449,"The bird's contact call is a rolling metallic krur-rr or kree, which may carry long distances and is always given while flying;  its alarm call is sharp.  ",1
1450,Displaying males vocalize a sequence of soft growling followed by a repetitive kred-kred-kred-kred.  ,1
1451,The red-tailed black cockatoo principally occurs across the drier parts of Australia. ,0
1452,"It is widespread and abundant in a broad band across the northern half of the country, where it has been considered an agricultural pest,  with more isolated distribution in the south. ",1
1453,"It is found in a wide variety of habitats, from shrublands and grasslands through eucalypt, sheoak and Acacia woodlands, to dense tropical rainforests.  ",1
1454,"The bird is dependent on large, old eucalypts for nesting hollows, although the specific gums used vary in different parts of the country. ",0
1455,"Cockatoos are not wholly migratory, but they do exhibit regular seasonal movements in different parts of Australia. ",0
1456,"In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer wet season.  ",1
1457,"In other parts of the country cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland,   and New South Wales. ",1
1458,"In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a northâsouth pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies naso,  while movements by subspecies samueli in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.  Red-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. ",1
1459,Flocks of up to 500 birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. ,0
1460,"In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal.  ",1
1461,"They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. ",0
1462,"The male red-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, and hiding the beak; it then sings and struts, ending in a jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him.  ",1
1463,"Breeding generally takes place from May to September except in the case of the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). ",0
1464,"Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods,  while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one.  ",1
1465,Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. ,0
1466,"Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. ",0
1467,"A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.  ",1

1471,"These vary across Australia but include the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt E. miniata across the north of the country, E. baxteri in Victoria and the bloodwood species Corymbia polycarpa and C. intermedia in Queensland. ",0
1472,"Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. ",0
1473,"Among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of Acacia, Allocasuarina, Banksia, Grevillea and Hakea, as well as berries, fruits and various insects.[44 ",0
1474,] Cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as the doublegee (Emex australis). ,0
1475,"There is some evidence of consumption of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), wild turnip (Brassica tournefortii) and melon (Citrullus or Cucumis).  Red-tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests of peanut and other crops at Lakeland Downs in Far North Queensland. ",1
1476,"Here the cockatoos, in flocks of up to several hundred birds, have learned to sever the peanut plants above ground level before pulling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. ",0
1477,"These birds are listed internationally under Appendix II of CITES, which allows international trade in live wild-caught and captive-bred specimens, if such exports are not detrimental to wild populations.  ",1
1478,The red-tailed black cockatoo is protected under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Act 2001. ,1
1479,"However, the current Australian restrictions on commercial exports from Australia are not imposed by CITES.  ",1
1480,C. b. graptogyne is also specifically listed as endangered on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. ,0
1481,"Status of the red-tailed black cockatoo as a species, and as a subspecies, also varies from state to state within Australia. ",0
1482,"For example: Like many Australian cockatoos and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo is threatened by the thriving illegal trade in bird smuggling.  ",1
1483,High demand and high transit mortality mean that many more birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.  ,1
1484,"In 1997, the Northern Territory Government's Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts (now defunct) proposed a plan for management of the trade in eggs and nestlings of C. b. macrorhynchus. ",0
1485,To date the plan has not been implemented. The Australian Senate inquiry into the Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife concluded in early 1998 that routine capture and commercial use of adult wild birds should be prohibited.  ,1
1486,"The bird is part of an annual census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Red-tailed and other black cockatoos.  ",1
1487,"In the late 1990s, red-tailed black cockatoos fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas.   ",1
1488,"Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. ",0
1489,"Hand-raised birds can be bought for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture.  ",1
1490,"The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity,  and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. ",1
1491,"Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. ",0
1492,Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. ,0
1493,"However, with an increase in interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.  ",1
1494,The birds breed easily in captivity  and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. ,1
1495,"Once the female has one egg in her nest, she will not lay another. ",0
1496,The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin feathers at about 6 weeks. ,0
1497,The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. ,0
1498,Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. ,0
1499,Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.  ,1
1500,"The large and powerful bills of these birds can quickly and easily open a Brazil nut (normally requiring crushing in a vise or pounding with a hammer), shearing it as neatly as a laser. ",0
1501,They can also demolish a whole coconut with husk in 3 days. ,0
1502,"Captive breeding guidelines may be found in Husbandry Guidelines for the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo (Bennett, 2008).  ",1
1503,The red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda) is a seabird native to tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. ,0
1504,"One of three closely related species of tropicbird (Phaethontidae), it was described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783. ",0
1505,"Superficially resembling a tern in appearance, it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. ",0
1506,"As referenced in the common name, adults have red tail streamers that are about twice their body length. ",0
1507,"Four subspecies are recognised, but there is evidence of clinal variation in body sizeâwith smaller birds in the north and larger in the southâand hence no grounds for subspecies. ",0
1508,The red-tailed tropicbird eats fishâmainly flying fish and squidâafter catching them by plunge-diving into the ocean. ,0
1509,"Nesting takes place in loose colonies on oceanic islands; the nest itself is a scrape found on a cliff face, in a crevice, or on a sandy beach. ",0
1510,"A single egg is laid, then is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. ",0
1511,"The parents make long food-foraging trips of about 150 hours during incubation, but once the chick has hatched, the parents specialize their foraging: one forages for the chick for a few hours at a time, while the other makes much longer trips to feed themselves. ",0
1512,"This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it is adversely affected by human contact. ",0
1513,Rats and feral cats prey on eggs and young at nesting sites. ,0
1514,The bird's tail streamers were once prized by some Hawaiian and Maori peoples. ,0
1515,"The British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on James Cook's first voyage, noting that it was a different species to the familiar red-billed tropicbird. ",0
1516,"It was the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon who formally described the species in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1781, noting it was a native of  Isle de France (Mauritius).  ",1
1517,The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by FrancÌ§ois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches EnlumineÌes D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  ,1
1518,"The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek phaethon, ""sun"", while the species epithet comes from the Latin words ruber ""red"" and cauda ""tail"".  ",1
1519,"English ornithologist John Latham wrote about the red-tailed tropicbird in 1785 in his General Synopsis of Birds, recording it as common in Mauritius and the South Pacific. ",0
1520,The British naturalist Walter Rothschild reviewed the described names and specimens in 1900 and concluded that the original use of P. erubescens was a nomen nudum. ,0
1521,"He concluded that the populations of Lord Howe, Norfolk and Kermadec Islands belonged to a distinct subspecies which he named P. rubicauda erubescens, due to their larger overall size, more robust bill and prominent reddish tinge to their plumage. ",0
1522,"The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews then applied the name P. rubicauda roseotinctus to Rothschild's P. rubicauda erubescens.  ""Red-tailed tropicbird"" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ",1
1523,"Other common names include red-tailed bos'nbird or silver bos'nbird, the names derived from the semblance of the tail feathers to a boatswain's marlin spikes, and strawtail.  ",1
1524,"The New Zealand MaÌori call it amokura,  and the native Hawaiians koaÊ»e Ê»ula.  ",1
1525,"Its closest relative is the white-tailed tropicbird (P. lepturus), the split between their ancestors taking place about four million years ago.  ",1
1526,"The red-tailed tropicbird measures 95 to 104 cm (37 to 41 in) on average, which includes the 35 cm (14 in) tail streamers, and weighs around 800 g (30 oz). ",0
1527,He also noted that the pink colouration was more intense in new plumage and faded after a few years in museum specimens.  ,1
1528,It has a wingspan of 111 to 119 cm (44 to 47 in). ,0
1529,"It has a streamlined but solid build with almost all-white plumage,  often with a pink tinge.  ",1
1530,"A dark brown comma-shaped stripe extends back from the lores, through and over the eyes and reaching the ear coverts.  ",1
1531,"The bill is bright red, slightly paler at the base and black around the nostrils. ",0
1532,"The legs and base of the toes are pale blue-mauve, while the webbing and rest of the toes are black.  ",1
1533,"The white feathers of the head and rump have concealed dark brown bases, while those of the mantle, back, tail rectrices and tail coverts have dark brown shaft bases. ",0
1534,"The two long tail feathers are orange or red with white bases for around a tenth of their length,  and can be hard to see when the bird is flying. ",1
1535,"The white wings are marked by dark chevron-shaped patches on the tertials, and the dark shafts of the primary flight feathers are visible.  ",1
1536,The pink tinge is often more pronounced in the remiges of the upper wing.  ,1
1537,"Moulting takes place outside the breeding season, the streamers being replaced before the rest of the feathers. ",0
1538,"Newly-hatched chicks are covered in thin, long, grey-white down, which is paler on the head. ",0
1539,"Streamers are replaced at any time, one growing while the other is shed, and old streamers may litter the area around a breeding colony.  ",1
1540,"The primaries, rectrices and scapulars are evident in the third week, and chicks are mostly feathered with residual down on underparts and under the wings after six weeks, and fully feathered by 11 weeks.  ",1
1541,"Juvenile birds have a glossy white forehead, chin, throat and underparts,  and prominent black barring and scaling on their crown, nape, mantle, back, rump and upper wing coverts.  ",1
1542,"Their bills are blackish grey with a light blue-grey base, and grey legs and feet.  ",1
1543,"In Australian waters the red-tailed tropicbird could be confused with the silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) or various tern species, though it is larger and heavier-set, with a wedge-shaped tail. ",0
1544,Its red bill and more wholly white wings distinguish it from the adult white-tailed tropicbird. ,0
1545,Immature red-tailed tropicbirds likewise can be distinguished from immature white-tailed tropicbirds by their partly red rather than yellow bills.  ,1
1546,"Aside from during courtship displays, birds may give a short greeting squawk to their mate when arriving or leaving the nest. ",0
1547,"Birds give a low growling call as a defence call, and young chatter repetitively as a begging callâmade whenever the parents are nearby.  ",1
1548,"The red-tailed tropicbird ranges across the southern Indian, and western and central Pacific Oceans, from the African coast to Indonesia, the waters around the southern reaches of Japan, across to Chile,  and the Hawaiian Islands, where they are more common on the northwestern islands.  ",1
1549,It frequents areas of ocean with water temperatures from 24 to 30 Â°C (75 to 86 Â°F) and salinity under 35% in the southern hemisphere and 33.5% in the northern hemisphere. ,0
1550,"In the Pacific Ocean, the southern boundary of its range runs along the 22 Â°C (72 Â°F) summer surface isotherm.  ",1
1551,"Evidence suggests birds in the Indian Ocean follow prevailing winds westwards, young individuals banded in Sumatra and Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia, being recovered at Mauritius and ReÌunion respectively.  ",1
1552,"Banding on Kure Atoll suggests birds in the North Pacific disperse in an easterly direction, following prevailing winds there.  ",1
1553,"Strong winds can blow them inland on occasions, which explains some sighting records away from the coast and their preferred habitats.  ",1
1554,"There are large breeding colonies on Europa,  Aldabra  and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, with smaller colonies in Madagascar, where it nests on the tiny island of Nosy Ve,  the Seychelles, and Mauritius.  ",1
1555,It is also found on the Australian territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean.  ,1
1556,"The warm waters of the Leeuwin Current facilitate the species nesting at Cape Leeuwin in southwestern Australia, yet is only a rare visitor to New South Wales at corresponding latitudes on the Australian east coast.  ",1
1557,"It also nests at Ashmore Reef and Rottnest Island off Western Australia, as well as Sugarloaf Rock at Cape Naturaliste and Busselton on the Western Australian coastline itself.  ",1
1558,"In the Pacific area, it nests on the Australian offshore territories of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands, and on Queensland's coral islands (including Raine Island and Lady Elliot Island).  ",1
1559,"In mid-2020 Australian scientists found a bird on Lady Elliott Island that they had banded 23 years earlier as a chick, but had not seen since, which had come back to breed on the island.  ",1
1560,"Elsewhere in the Pacific it breeds in Fiji, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Hawaii âwith a large colony on Kure Atoll âthe Cook Islands, Pitcairn Island, and islands off Japan and Chile.  ",1
1561,"It is an occasional visitor to Palau, breeding being recorded from the Southwest Islands,  and was first recorded from Guam in 1992.  ",1
1562,"It is an uncommon vagrant to New Zealand proper, where it has been recorded from the northern reaches of North Island, especially Three Kings Islands.  ",1
1563,"It is a very rare vagrant to North America, with records from California and Vancouver Island.  ",1
1564,"The red-tailed tropicbird is a strong flyer, and walks on land with difficulty using a shuffling gait.  ",1
1565,"KiÌlauea Point, Hawaii The red-tailed tropicbird is thought to be monogamous,  pairs remaining bonded over successive breeding seasons, although such information as age at first breeding and pair-formation is not known.  ",1
1566,"It nests in loose colonies,  on offshore islands and stacks, rocky cliffs, coral atolls and cays. ",1
1567,"It rarely nests on large bodies of land, though has done so in southern Western Australia.  ",1
1568,"The nest itself is a shallow scrape, in either shaded sand  or a rocky crevice,  or under a shrub. ",1
1569,"Because the red-tailed tropicbird does not walk well, it lands by flying into the wind, stalling and dropping to the ground. ",0
1570,The nest is often located within one metre (3.3 ft) of the edge of the shrub (or other shaded area) to minimise walking distance. ,0
1571,"The species is territorial to a degree, aggressively defending the nest site and pecking radius around it, commencing around three months before breeding.  ",1
1572,"Birds are more aggressive at crowded colonies, where numbers are large or suitable nest sites less common. ",0
1573,"They adopt a defence posture, which consists of raising the humeri up and bringing the wrists together, drawing the neck into the body and shaking the head sideways, fluffing up the head feathers and squawking. ",0
1574,"Bill-jabbing and fights can break out, the two combatants locking bills and wrestling for up to 90 minutes.  ",1
1575,"Mate choice is likely to be based partially on the length of the tail streamers, a bird having longer tail streamers being more attractive as a mate. ",0
1576,"This tropicbird also probably mates assortatively for tail streamer length, meaning mates likely have streamers of about equal length.  ",1
1577,"In the leadup to breeding, males initiate an aerial courtship display of flying in large circles, alternating between gliding, short periods of rapid wing-beating, and low flight within a few metres of the water, while making sharp cackling calls. ",0
1578,"Initially flying in small groups, birds then pair off to repeat the display in pairs before bonding. ",0
1579,"Once pairs have established a nest, they do not perform the display.  ",1
1580,"The timing of breeding depends on location; in some places, birds breed in a defined breeding season, whereas in others, there is none. ",0
1581,"South of the equator, the latter is likely to be true. ",0
1582,"On islands near the equator, laying usually occurs from June to November, the majority of chicks fledging around January to February.  On Christmas Island, breeding takes place at different times on different parts of the island due to prevailing weather conditions.  ",1
1583,"On sub-tropical Lady Elliott Island off Queensland, they nest in winter, which scientists think may be timed to avoid the common breeding times of most migratory species of seabird, such as the noisy Wedge-tailed Shearwater (mutton bird). ",0
1584,"The female red-tailed tropicbird lays one egg, which both parents incubate  for 42 to 46 days.  ",1
1585,"Ranging from 5.4 to 7.7 centimetres (2.1 to 3.0 in) long (averaging between 6.3 and 6.8 centimetres (2.5 and 2.7 in), depending on location) and 4.5 to 4.8 centimetres (1.8 to 1.9 in) wide, the oval eggs are pale tan with brown and red-black markings that are more prominent on the larger end.  ",1
1586,The male generally takes the first turn on the egg after it is laid.  ,1
1587,"Born helpless and unable to move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are initially blind, opening their eyes after 2â3 days. ",0
1588,"Until they are a week old, they open their beak only upon touch, so the parents have to stroke the base of the bill to initiate feeding. ",0
1589,"Feeding takes place once or twice a day, generally around midday. ",0
1590,"They are constantly brooded by the parents until they are a week old, after which time they are sheltered under the parentsâ wings. ",0
1591,They also rise up and gape at any nearby bird for food.  ,1
1592,"Both parents feed the young,  by shoving its beak into the chick's gullet and then regurgitating food.  ",1
1593,"Initially covered with grey or white down, they grow their first feathersâscapularsâat 16â20 days. ",0
1594,"Their feet and beaks grow rapidly, outpacing the rest of their bodies.  Chicks remain in the nest for 67 to 91 days until they fledge.  ",1
1595,"The red-tailed tropicbird is mostly a plunge diver, diving anywhere from an above-water height of 6 to 50 metres (20 to 164 ft),  to a depth of about 4.5 metres (15 ft), although this may change seasonally.  ",1
1596,"When diving, it remains briefly submergedâone study on Christmas Island came up with an average time of 26.6 secondsâgenerally swallowing its prey before surfacing.  ",1
1597,"During incubation, foraging trips are relatively long, with an average excursion taking about 153 hours. ",0
1598,"After the chicks hatch, on the other hand, the parents adopt a strategy where one takes long trips (these averaging about 57 hours) for self feeding, and the other takes short trips (about three hours long) to feed the chicks. ",0
1599,The bimodality of the length of foraging trips is likely to be because of the fact that it is the optimal balance of self-feeding and provisioning for chicks.  ,1
1600,"Squid and flying fish make up a large portion of this bird's diet, along with some crustaceans, depending on location.[37 ",0
1601,"On Christmas Island, birds generally forage far out to sea in the early morning and closer to shore in the afternoon.  ",1
1602,Fieldwork in the Mozambique Channel revealed the diet of birds there to be mostly fish by mass but equal numbers of fish and squid caught. ,0
1603,"Fish recorded include the mirrorwing flyingfish (Hirundichthys speculiger) and spotfin flyingfish (Cheilopogon furcatus) and several other unidentified species of the flying fish family Exocoetidae, the pompano dolphinfish (Coryphaena equiselis) and common dolphinfish (C. hippurus), needleflish including the houndfish (Tylosurus crocodilus), and unidentified members of Hemiramphidae, Scombridae, and Carangidae. ",0
1604,"The purpleback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) was by far the most common cephalopod eaten, followed by the common blanket octopus (Tremoctopus violaceus).  ",1
1605,"A field study in Hawaii found flying fish dominated the prey species, the tropical two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus volitans) and members of the genus Cypselurus prominent, followed by squid of the family Ommastrephidae including the purpleback flying squid and the glass squid (Hyaloteuthis pelagica), and carangid fish including the shortfin scad (Decapterus macrosoma).  ",1
1606,"The red-tailed tropicbird has also been recorded eating porcupinefish (Diodontidae), although adults have been troubled when the victim fish inflates resulting in it being urgently regurgitated.  ",1
1607,"A strong flyer with large mouth and bill, the red-tailed tropicbird can carry relatively large prey for its size, parent birds commonly bearing dolphin fish that weighed 120 gâ16% of their own weightâto their chicks.  ",1
1608,"When incubating during the day in a shaded nest, this bird has an average temperature of 39 Â°C (102 Â°F), compared to its average temperature when incubating at night of 37.1 Â°C (98.8 Â°F). ",0
1609,"The difference is likely due to activity levels, as the air temperature during these times does not differ significantly with a bird in the nest. ",0
1610,"After flying, the average body temperature is 40.9 Â°C (105.6 Â°F). ",0
1611,"The temperature of the feet is always lower than that of the body temperature during flight, but always higher than the air temperature. ",0
1612,"Thus, the feet are likely used to dissipate heat during flight.  ",1
1613,The red-tailed tropicbird's tail streamers were highly prized by the Maori. ,0
1614,"The NgaÌpuhi tribe of the Northland Region would look for and collect them off dead or stray birds blown ashore after easterly gales, trading them for greenstone with tribes from the south.  ",1
1615,"English naturalist Andrew Bloxam reported that the feathers were valued in Hawaii, where the locals would pull them off the birds as they nested.  ",1
1616,"The red-tailed tropicbird is classified as a least-concern species according to the IUCN on account of its large range of up to 20 thousand square kilometres (7,700 sq mi).  ",1
1617,"The population in the eastern Pacific has been estimated to be as high as 80,000 birds with a minimum of 41,000 birds.  ",1
1618,"Around 9,000 birds breed on Europa Island,  and 9,000â12,000 breed on the Hawaiian islands.  ",1
1619,"Human presence generally affects the species adversely, by the destruction of habitat or introduction of pests.  ",1
1620,"Within Australia, it is classified as near threatened, due to unexpected declines in some populations, the impact of humans, and the yellow crazy ant overrunning Christmas Island.  ",1
1621,"Predators recorded in Western Australia include large raptors such as the white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and the eastern osprey (Pandion cristatus); while silver gulls, and crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) raid nests for eggs and young.  Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds (P. aethereus) have been implicated in egg loss of nests in Hawaii.  ",1
1622,"Feral dogs and cats prey on nesting birds on Christmas Island,  while feral cats are a severe problem on Norfolk Island.  ",1
1623,"Rats have been a serious problem on Kure Atoll, causing heavy losses.  ",1
1624,"Yellow crazy ants were discovered on Johnston Atoll in the north Pacific Ocean in 2010, hordes of which overrun nesting areas and can blind victims with their spray.  ",1
1625,"Also on Johnston Atoll, the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS) was burning stockpiled chemical weapons until 2000. ",0
1626,It was studied over eight years to see if there were effects from potential contaminants. ,0
1627,"There appeared to be no impact on survival during the study period, although young birds from downwind of the plant were less likely to return there than those upwind of the plantâpossibly due to the more intact vegetation at the latter site.  ",1
1628,Scientists studying the bird on Lady Elliot Island off the Queensland coast in 2020 say that the lack of knowledge about its habits and populations means that they don't know how much environmental changes are affecting its populations. ,0
1629,"Their study includes taking DNA samples, banding new chicks and fitting birds with satellite trackers, in a bit to find out more about their movements. ",1
1630,The red-throated loon (North America) or red-throated diver (Britain and Ireland) (Gavia stellata) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere. ,0
1631,"The most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family, it breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. ",0
1632,"Ranging from 55 to 67 centimetres (22 to 26 in) in length, the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. ",0
1633,"In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. ",0
1634,"During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name. ",0
1635,"Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates, and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. ",0
1636,"Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch), and feed the hatched young. ",0
1637,"The red-throated loon has a large global population and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. ",0
1638,"Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution, and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. ",0
1639,"Natural predatorsâincluding various gull species, and both red and Arctic foxes, will take eggs and young. ",0
1640," Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now-defunct genus Colymbus, which contained grebes as well as loons. ",0
1641,"First described by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. ",1
1642,"By 1788, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus.  ",1
1643,"Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all belong to the same genus, it differs from the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology  and may be the basal lineage of the genus.  ",1
1644,"It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic.  ",1
1645,"Analysis of molecular data together with the fossil record suggests the lineage of the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the Miocene, and that it may be most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species Gavia howardae.  ",1
1646,"The specific epithet stellata is Latin for ""set with stars"" or ""starry"",  and refers to the bird's speckled back in its non-breeding plumage.  ",1
1647,"The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for ""sea mew"", as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder.  ",1
1648,Members of the family Gavidae are known as loons in North America and divers in Great Britain and Ireland.  ,1
1649,The International Ornithological Congress uses the name red-throated loon for this species.  ,1
1650,"""Diver"" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey, while ""red-throated"" is a straightforward reference to the bird's most distinctive breeding plumage feature. ",0
1651,"The word ""loon"" is thought to have derived from the Swedish lom, the Old Norse or Icelandic loÌmr, or the Old Dutch loen, all of which mean ""lame"" or ""clumsy"", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land.  ",1
1652,"Like the other members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legsâin their set-back positionâprovide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. ",0
1653,"Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.  ",1
1654,"The red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loon species, ranging from 53 to 69 cm (21 to 27 in) in length  with a 91â120 cm (36â47 in) wingspan,   and weighing 1â2.7 kg (2.2â6.0 lb).  Like all loons, it is long-bodied and short-necked, with its legs set far back on its body.  ",1
1655,"The sexes are similar in appearance, although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females.  ",1
1656,"In breeding plumage, the adult has a dark grey head and neck (with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck), a triangular red throat patch, white underparts, and a dark grey-brown mantle.  ",1
1657,It is the only loon with an all-dark back in breeding plumage.  ,1
1658,"The non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin, foreneck, and much of the face white, the top of the head and back of the neck grey, and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle.  ",1
1659,"Its iris is carmine-red to burgundy in color, its legs are black on the outer half and pale on the inner half, and the webs of its feet are pinkish-brown, with darker margins.  ",1
1660,"Its bill is thin, straight, and sharp, and often held at an uptilted angle.  ",1
1661,"One of the bird's North American folk names is pegging-awl loon, a reference to its sharply pointed bill, which resembles a sailmaker's awl (a tool also known as a ""pegging awl"" in New England).  ",1
1662,"Though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter, the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird's overall plumage change. ",0
1663,The nostrils are narrow slits located near the base of the bill.  ,1
1664,"When it first emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon is covered with fine soft down feathers. ",0
1665,"Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. ",0
1666,"Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers.  ",1
1667,"The juvenile's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. ",0
1668,"It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. ",0
1669,"Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. ",0
1670,"Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. ",0
1671,"Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.  ",1
1672,"In flight, the red-throated loon has a distinctive profile; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. ",0
1673,"The adult red-throated loon has a number of vocalisations, which are used in different circumstances. ",0
1674,"In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cacklesâkaa-kaa-kaa or kak-kak-kak, at roughly five calls per second. ",0
1675,"Its warning call, if disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. ",0
1676,"A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. ",0
1677,"The species also has a short wailing callâaarOOao aarOOao âwhich descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. ",0
1678,"Another callâa harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a rowâis used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water.  ",1
1679," Young have a shrill closed-bill call, which they use in begging and to contact their parents. ",0
1680,"Known as the ""long call"", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons;  the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's. ",1
1681,They also have a long call used in response to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.  ,1
1682,"At medium to close range, an adult red-throated loon in either breeding or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. ",0
1683,"However, in certain light conditions, at certain times in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another speciesâmost commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. ",0
1684,"It shows more white on the head and neck than does the black-throated loon, andâprovided it is not sitting low in the waterâtends to show more white on the flanks as well. ",0
1685,"If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.  ",1
1686,"The red-throated loon breeds primarily in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50Â°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters,  sometimes in groups of considerable size. ",1
1687,"More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the German Bight, for example.  ",1
1688,"Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. ",0
1689,"Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. ",0
1690,The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size outweigh the limitations.  ,1
1691,"In North America, it winters regularly along both coasts, ranging as far south as the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California in north-western Mexico; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior Mexican state of Hidalgo.  ",1
1692,"Some of its folk names in north-eastern North Americaâincluding cape race, cape brace, cape drake and cape racer, as well as corruptions such as scapegraceâoriginated from its abundance around Cape Race, Newfoundland.  ",1
1693,"In Europe, it breeds in Iceland, northern Scotland, north-western Ireland (only a few pairs breed ), Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters along the coast as far south as parts of Spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways, including the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas, as well as large rivers, lakes and reservoirs.  ",1
1694,"It has occurred as a vagrant as far south as Morocco, Tunisia and the Gambia.  ",1
1695,"In Asia, it breeds in the northern stretches of Siberia, and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as China, Japan and Taiwan. ",0
1696,"Because its feet are located so far back on its body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast.  ",1
1697,"Young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea.  ",1
1698,It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land.  ,1
1699,"If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the surface of the water.  ",1
1700,"The red-throated loon is a diurnal migrant, which travels singly or in loose groups, often high above the water.  ",1
1701,"In eastern North America (and possibly elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore;  ",1
1702,Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds.  ,1
1703,"It is a strong flier, and has been clocked at speeds between 75 and 78 kilometres per hour (47 and 48 mph).  ",1
1704,"Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing moult, losing all its flight feathers at once and becoming flightless for a period of three to four weeks. ",0
1705,Unlike other loonsâwhich undergo this moult in late winterâthe red-throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn.  ,1
1706,"Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon is primarily a fish-eater, though it sometimes feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic invertebrates, insects, fish spawn or even plant material.  ",1
1707,"It seizes rather than spears its prey, which is generally captured underwater.  ",1
1708,"Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion, it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly.  ",1
1709,"Pursuit dives range from 2â9 m (6.6â29.5 ft) in depth, with an average underwater time of about a minute.  ",1
1710,"Its fish diet increases the red-throated loon's vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, both of which bioaccumulate, thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) at or near the top of the food chain.  ",1
1711,"Its main diet has also led to several of the loon's British folk names, including ""sprat borer"" and ""spratoon"".  ",1
1712,"For the first few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents. ",0
1713,"After 3â4 days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. ",0
1714,"Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.   ",1
1715,"By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same foodâof the same sizeâas their parents do.  ",1
1716,The red-throated loon is a monogamous species which forms long-term pair bonds. ,0
1717,"Both sexes build the nest, which is a shallow scrape (or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers, and placed within a half-metre (18 in) of the edge of a small pond. ",0
1718,"The female lays two eggs (though clutches of one and three have also been recorded); they are incubated for 24â29 days, primarily by the female. ",0
1719," Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid, so they hatch asynchronously. ",0
1720,"The eggs, which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black, measure 75 mm Ã 46 mm (3.0 in Ã 1.8 in) and have a mass of 83 g (2.9 oz), of which 8% is shell.  ",1
1721,"If a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding, for example) before the young hatch, the red-throated loon usually lays a second clutch, generally in a new nest.  ",1
1722,"The young birds are precocial: upon hatching, they are downy and mobile, with open eyes. ",0
1723,"Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially, then small fish for 38â48 days. ",0
1724,Parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young.  ,1
1725,Ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do  and others the opposite.  ,1
1726,"In the wild, the oldest known red-throated loon lived for more than two decades.  ",1
1727,"It was found, oiled and dead, on a beach in Sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been ringed (banded).  ",1
1728,"Although the red-throated loon is not a globally threatened species, as it has a large population and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. ",0
1729,"Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example,  and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well.  ",1
1730,"In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage.  ",1
1731,"In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000 individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.  ",1
1732,"The red-throated loon is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies;  in the Americas, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.  Oil spills, habitat degradation, and fishing nets are among the main threats this species faces.  ",1
1733,"Because it tends to migrate close to shoreâgenerally within 20 kilometres (12 mi) of landâit may be detrimentally affected by the construction of near-shore wind farms;  studies indicate a high level of avoidance of wind farm areas, though deaths due to direct strikes with the turbines appear to be uncommon.  High levels of mercury in the environment have led to reproductive failures in some areas, including parts of Sweden.  ",1
1734,"Studies in Sweden have also shown that they may be adversely impacted by the acidification of lakes, as the fish on which they prey are susceptible to low pH.  while great skuas, Arctic skuas and various species of Larus gulls (including great black-backed gulls and glaucous gulls)   are predators of both eggs and young.  ",1
1735,"The species is known to serve as host for at least 51 species of parasites, most of which are roundworms (nematodes), flatworms (digeneans) and tapeworms (cestodes) carried internally; a single species of louse is its only known external parasite.  ",1
1736,It is also known to sometimes carry significant populations of diatoms (microscopic phytoplankton) on its contour feathers.  ,1
1737,"Type E botulism,  and is regularly killed by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by ""red tide"" algal blooms.  ",1
1738,"During a 2007 bloom, large numbers of the birds also died of hypothermia, after their plumages became matted by a protein byproduct of the algae, which reduced the insulating properties of their feathers.  Used as a food source since prehistoric times,   the red-throated loon is still hunted by indigenous peoples in some parts of the world ",1
1739,"In some parts of Russia, red-throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations, including collars.  ",1
1740,The species was also central to the creation mythologies of indigenous groups throughout the Holarctic.  ,1
1741,"According to the mythâwhich varies only slightly between versions, despite the sometimes-vast distances that separated the groups who believed itâthe loon was asked by a great shaman to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea. ",0
1742,That earth was then used to build the world's dry land.  ,1
1743,"As recently as the 1800s, the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain.   In the Orkney and Shetland islands of Scotland, the species is still known as the ""rain goose"" in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities.  ",1
1744,"The people of the Faroe Islands believed that if the red-throated loon miaowed like a cat, then rain was imminent, while a call of gaa-gaa-gaa or turkatrae-turkatrae predicted fine weather.  ",1
1745,"The red-winged fairywren (Malurus elegans) is a species of passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae. ",0
1746,"Bhutan, Japan, AÌland (an autonomous region of Finland), and the Union of the Comoros have issued stamps featuring the red-throated loon.  ",1
1747,It is non-migratory and endemic to the southwestern corner of Western Australia. ,0
1748,"Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism, the male adopts a brilliantly coloured breeding plumage, with an iridescent silvery-blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, red shoulders, contrasting with a black throat, grey-brown tail and wings and pale underparts. ",0
1749,"Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, though males may bear isolated blue and black feathers. ",0
1750,"Similar in appearance and closely related to the variegated fairywren and the blue-breasted fairywren, it is regarded as a separate species as no intermediate forms have been recorded where their ranges overlap. ",0
1751,"Though the red-winged fairywren is locally common, there is evidence of a decline in numbers.  ",1
1752,"Bearing a narrow pointed bill adapted for probing and catching insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages and lives in the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by karri trees, remaining close to cover to avoid predators. ",0
1753,"Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. ",0
1754,Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. ,0
1755,There is a higher proportion of female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. ,0
1756,A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. ,0
1757,"Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals by song alone. ",0
1758,Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. ,0
1759,"The red-winged fairywren was described by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who gave it the bird's specific name which is derived from the Latin term elegans 'elegant'.  ",1
1760,"He noted its location as the eastern coast of Australia, but corrected his error after further collections by John Gilbert from south-western Australia.  ",1
1761,Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 on the basis of darker female plumage.  ,1
1762,"However, others have not observed this subsequently and the current consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized.  ",1
1763,In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.  ,1
1764,"It is one of eleven species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea.  ",1
1765,Within the genus it belongs to a group of four very similar species known collectively as chestnut-shouldered fairywrens. ,0
1766,"The other three species are the lovely fairywren, the variegated fairywren, and the blue-breasted fairywren.  ",1
1767,Molecular study showed the blue-breasted fairywren to be the most closely related to the red-winged fairywren.  ,1
1768,"Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is unrelated to the true wrens. ",0
1769,"Initially, fairywrens were thought to be a member of the Old World flycatcher family, or the warbler family, Sylviidae, before being placed in the newly recognised Australasian wren family, Maluridae, in 1975.  ",1
1770,"More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to the honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) and the pardalotes (Pardalotidae) in a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.   ",1
1771,Alternative names for the red-winged fairywren include red-winged blue-wren and red-winged wren. ,0
1772,"In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group due to the variety of forms in the north and their absence in the southeast of the continent.  ",1
1773,Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. ,0
1774,Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in the loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. ,0
1775,"South-western birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren. ",0
1776,"Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. ",0
1777,Cooler climate then resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. ,0
1778,"Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,000â13,000 years ago, the northern variegated forms again spread southwards. ",0
1779,This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping.  ,1
1780,"The red-winged fairywren is 15 cm (6 in) long and weighs 8â11 g (0.28â0.39 oz), making it the largest of the fairywrens.  ",1
1781,"The average tail length is 7.5 cm (3.0 in), among the longest in the genus.   ",1
1782,"Averaging 10 mm (0.4 in) in males and 9.3 mm (0.4 in) in females, the bill is relatively long, narrow and pointed, and wider at the base.  ",1
1783,"Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or by picking insects off of their environs.  Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting with black and grey-brown. ",1
1784,"The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays.  ",1
1785,"The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and a greyish-white belly. ",0
1786,"Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. ",0
1787,"All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. ",0
1788,Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching.  ,1
1789,"This has a patchy or spotty appearance, with a mixture of blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. ",0
1790,"Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year.  ",1
1791,"Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.  ",1
1792,"Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. ",0
1793,"They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring.  Body feathers are replaced at both moults while wing and tail feathers are in spring only, though the latter may be replaced at any time if damaged or worn.  ",1
1794,"The blue coloured plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, of the breeding males is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules.  ",1
1795,Vocal communication among red-winged fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory.  ,1
1796,"The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.  ",1
1797,"They are able to distinguish different individuals on the basis of song alone, which is integral to the identification of group members and strangers.  The basic, or ""type one"", song is a one to four second high-pitched reel consisting of 10â20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females, particularly when there is a dispute over territory boundaries.   ",1
1798,"Foraging birds maintain contact with each other by soft, repeating see-see-see descending tones, while a loud, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.  ",1
1799,"The red-winged fairywren occurs in the wetter, southwest corner of Western Australia, from Moore River north of Perth south through to the Margaret River region and east to Albany.  ",1
1800,"It is common in parts of its range,  though there is some evidence of decline from draining of swampland.   ",1
1801,Forestry plantations of pine and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack sufficient undergrowth.  ,1
1802,"Older forests appear to be less favourable habitats, while birds appear to be attracted to disturbed areas after logging.  ",1
1803,"Fire also results in populations disappearing, returning after a period of two years.  ",1
1804,"It borders the range of the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with those two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests.  ",1
1805,"Within the forest habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and riverside sword sedge.  ",1
1806,The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.  ,1
1807,"Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for red-winged fairywren conservation are Araluen-Wungong, Jalbarragup, Mundaring-Kalamunda, North Dandalup, the Stirling Range, Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks.  ",1
1808,"Hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously, is the usual form of locomotion, though birds may run while performing the ""rodent run display "" detailed below.  ",1
1809,"Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. ",0
1810,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  ",1
1811,"The red-winged fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with a pair or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round. ",0
1812,The area maintained is large enough to support the group in poor years or to accommodate new members after a good breeding season.  ,1
1813,"These territories average around 0.4â2.4 hectares (1â6 acres) in optimal habitat of tall karri forest, although are smaller and restricted to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitats. ",1
1814,"Groups range from two to nine members in size with an average of four birds,  the largest for any fairywren studied to date. ",1
1815,"Pairs are socially monogamous, with relationships ending for the most part when one partner dies. ",0
1816,This is thought to be due to a very high annual survival and occupancy of suitable territory. ,0
1817,"Though reproduction rates are low, young birds still have few vacancies available for them to disperse into.  ",1
1818,"The survivor in this case selects a new partner, often a helper bird in the group. ",0
1819,"Though not directly studied, paired red-winged fairywrens are likely to be sexually promiscuous, with each partner mating with other individuals.  ",1
1820,"Female helpers are much more common in this species than the other species intensively studied, the superb fairywren.  ",1
1821,"Over half of the groups have two or more helpers, often female, which feed nestlings and reduce the workload of breeding females.  ",1
1822,Helpers have been shown to improve reproductive success in this species by increasing the number of young raised successfully per year from 1.3 to 2 birds.  ,1
1823," Like other fairywrens, male red-winged fairywrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part of a courtship ritual. ",0
1824,"There is some evidence that groups with male helpers may enlarge the territory boundaries with a subsequent ""budding-off"" of a new territory by a helper. ",1
1825,"In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or, rarely, white.  ",1
1826,"Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own, or another's, territory.  ",1
1827,"The ""face fan"" display is commonly seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours;  it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.  ",1
1828,The silvery blue upper back feathers are also used more prominently in display than other species.  ,1
1829,"The breeding season is shorter than that of other fairywrens, occurring from October (rarely September) through to December. ",0
1830,"Constructed solely by the female,  the nest is generally situated in thick vegetation and around 20 cm (8 in) above the ground. ",1
1831,"It is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side. ",0
1832,The interior may be lined with finer grass and material from common clematis and Bull Banksia. ,0
1833,"One or, rarely, two broods may be laid in a season, the second being laid on average 51 days after the first.  ",1
1834,"A clutch consists of two or three matte cream-white eggs, tapered oval in shape with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 mm Ã 16 mm (0.47 in Ã 0.63 in).  ",1
1835," Incubation takes 14 to 15 days, a day less in later broods,  and an estimated 94% of eggs hatch successfully. ",1
1836,"The female incubates the eggs alone for around an hour at a time, after which the male calls her and she will leave to forage urgently for 15â30 minutes before returning. ",0
1837,Her long tail is often bent from the cramped nest space and is a useful field indicator of nesting. ,1
1838,"The newly hatched nestlings are altricialâraw red in colour, naked and blind. ",0
1839,"Within a day, their skin darkens to blueâgrey colour as their feathers develop underneath. ",0
1840,Sheathed primary feathers emerge through the skin by the third day and eyes begin to open on the fifth day and fully open on the next. ,0
1841,"Young are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 11â12 days, by which time they are fledged. ",0
1842,"Though fully feathered, their tails and wings are not fully grown and they are poor fliers.  ",1
1843,"Their wings take another 10 days to develop fully, during which time they generally stay well hidden in cover near the nest. ",0
1844,Parents and helper birds will feed them for around one month after fledging. ,0
1845,Young birds often remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group. ,0
1846,"Birds reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but females tend not to breed until their third year as breeding vacancies are scarce.  ",1
1847,"Like all fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is an active and restless feeder,  foraging in bracken and low shrubs, as well as in leaf-litter on the ground near shelter. ",1
1848,"The nests of red-winged fairywrens rarely play host to brood parasites, though parasitism by the Horsfield's bronze cuckoo and the fan-tailed cuckoo has been recorded.  ",1
1849,"It will occasionally ascend trees up to 5 m (16 ft) above the ground in the understorey, particularly in the late summer and autumn as the flaking eucalypt bark is a rich source of arthropods. ",0
1850,"However, birds are exposed to potential predators and forays are therefore brief. ",0
1851,"During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. ",0
1852,"They consumes a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects, eating ants and beetles year-round, and adding spiders, bugs and caterpillars to their diet during breeding season.   ",1
1853,"Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. ",0
1854,Groups often shelter and rest together during the heat of the day. ,0
1855,Food is harder to find during the winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.  ,1
1856,"Ants in particular are an important food source during this period, constituting a high proportion of the diet.  ",1
1857,"Like other species of fairywrens, red-winged fairywrens may use a ""rodent-run display"" to distract predators from nests with young birds. ",0
1858,"Major nest predators include Australian magpies, butcherbirds, laughing kookaburras, currawongs, crows and ravens, and shrike-thrushes as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox, cat and black rat.  ",1
1859,"While doing this, the head, neck and tail of the bird are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
1860,"Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering display is seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male courtship displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. ",0
1861,"Survival of fairywrens from one season to the next is generally high for such small birds, and the red-winged fairywren has the highest rate of allâwith 78% of breeding males and 77% of breeding females surviving from year to year.  ",1
1862,"The fairywren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.  ",1
1863,"It is not unusual for red-winged fairywrens to reach 10 years of age, and the oldest known individual to date attained an age of 16 years.  ",1
1864,The red rail (Aphanapteryx bonasia) is an extinct species of flightless rail. ,0
1865,"It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. ",0
1866,"It had a close relative on Rodrigues island, the likewise extinct Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), with which it is sometimes considered congeneric. ",0
1867,"Rails often evolve flightlessness when adapting to isolated islands, free of mammalian predators. ",0
1868,"The red rail was a little larger than a chicken and had reddish, hairlike plumage, with dark legs and a long, curved beak. ",0
1869,"The wings were small, and its legs were slender for a bird of its size. ",0
1870,"It was similar to the Rodrigues rail, but was larger, and had proportionally shorter wings. ",0
1871,It has been compared to a kiwi or a limpkin in appearance and behaviour. ,0
1872,"It is believed to have fed on invertebrates, and snail shells have been found with damage matching an attack by its beak. ",0
1873,Human hunters took advantage of an attraction red rails had to red objects by using coloured cloth to lure the birds so that they could be beaten with sticks. ,0
1874,"Until subfossil remains were discovered in the 1860s, scientists only knew the red rail from 17th century descriptions and illustrations. ",0
1875,"These were thought to represent several different species, which resulted in a large number of invalid junior synonyms. ",0
1876,"It has been suggested that all late 17th-century accounts of the dodo actually referred to the red rail, after the former had become extinct. ",0
1877,"The last mention of a red rail sighting is from 1693, and it is thought to have gone extinct around 1700, due to predation by humans and introduced species. ",0
1878,"The red rail was first mentioned as ""Indian river woodcocks"" by the Dutch shipsâ pilot Heyndrick Dircksz Jolinck in 1598.  ",1
1879,"By the 19th century, the bird was known only from a few contemporary descriptions referring to red ""hens"" and names otherwise used for grouse or partridges in Europe, as well as the sketches of the Dutch merchant Pieter van den Broecke and the English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert from 1646 and 1634. ",0
1880,The Belgian scientist Edmond de SeÌlys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis bonasia based on the old accounts mentioned by Strickland. ,0
1881,"While they differed in some details, they were thought to depict a single species by the English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1848.   ",1
1882,"He also included two other Mascarene birds, at the time only known from contemporary accounts, in the genus Apterornis: the ReÌunion ibis (now Threskiornis solitarius); and the ReÌunion swamphen (now Porphyrio caerulescens). ",0
1883,"He thought them related to the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, due to their shared rudimentary wings, tail, and the disposition of their digits.    ",1
1884,"The name Apterornis had already been used for a different extinct bird genus from New Zealand (originally spelled Aptornis, the adzebills) by the British biologist Richard Owen earlier in 1848. ",0
1885,"Some early accounts refer to red rails by the vernacular names for the hazel grouse, Tetrastes bonasia, so the name evidently originates there. ",0
1886,"The name itself perhaps refers to bonasus, meaning ""bull"" in Latin, or bonum and assum, meaning ""good roast"". ",0
1887,"It has also been suggested to be a Latin form of the French word bonasse, meaning simple-minded or good-natured.  ",1
1888,It is also possible that the name  alludes to bulls due the bird being said to have had a similar attraction to the waving of red cloth.  ,1
1889,"The German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel thought van den Broecke's sketch depicted a smaller dodo species from Mauritius, and that the Herbert sketch showed a dodo from Rodrigues, and named them Didus broecki and Didus herberti in 1854.  ",1
1890,"In the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found along with remains of other Mauritian animals in the Mare aux Songes swamp, and were identified as belonging to a rail by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1866.  ",1
1891,"In 1968, the Austrian naturalist Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld brought attention to paintings by the Flemish artist Jacob Hoefnagel depicting animals in the royal menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague, including a dodo and a bird he named Aphanapteryx imperialis. ",0
1892,"He compared it with the birds earlier named form old accountss, and found its beak similar to that of a kiwi or ibis.    ",1
1893,"In 1869, Milne-Edwards proposed that the subfossil bones from Mauritius belonged to the bird in the Hoiefnagel painting, and combined the genus name with the older specific name broecki.  ",1
1894,"Due to nomenclatural priority, the genus name was later combined with the oldest species name bonasia.   ",1
1895,"In the 1860s, the travel journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland (1601â1603) was rediscovered, which contains good sketches of several now-extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle, including an unlabelled red rail.  ",1
1896,"More fossils were later found by Theodore Sauzier, who had been commissioned to explore the ""historical souvenirs"" of Mauritius in 1889.  ",1
1897,"In 1899, an almost complete specimen was found by the barber Louis Etienne Thirioux, who also found important dodo remains, in a cave in the ValleÌe des PreÌtres; this is the most completely known red rail specimen, and is catalogued as MI 923 in the Mauritius Institute. ",0
1898,The second most complete individual (specimen CMNZ AV6284) also mainly consists of bones from the Thirioux collection. ,0
1899,"The yellowish colouration mentioned by English traveller Peter Mundy in 1638 instead of the red of other accounts was used by the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka in 1937 as an argument for this referring to a distinct species, Kuina mundyi, but the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson suggested in 1977 it was possibly due to the observed bird being a juvenile.  ",1
1900,"Apart from being a close relative of the Rodrigues rail, the relationships of the red rail are uncertain. ",0
1901,"The two are commonly kept as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have also been united as species of Aphanapteryx at times.  ",1
1902,"They were first generically synonymised by the British ornithologists Edward Newton and Albert GuÌnther in 1879, due to skeletal similarities.  ",1
1903,"In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes described Hawkins's rail, an extinct species of rail from the Chatham Islands, as a new species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. ",0
1904,"He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands, as part of a lost continent he called ""Antipodea"". ",0
1905,"Forbes moved the Chatham Islands bird to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx, in 1893, on the recommendation of Newton, but later reverted to his older name. ",0
1906,"The idea that the Chatham Islands bird was closely related to the red rail and the idea of a connection between the Mascarenes and the Chatham Islands were later criticised by the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews due to no other species being shared between the islands, and the German ornithologist Hans F. Gadow explained the similarity between the two rails as parallel evolution.    ",1
1907,"In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the red and Rodrigues rail different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. ",0
1908,"Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they were related to the genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus.  ",1
1909,"The American ornithologist Bradley C. Livezey was unable to determine the affinities of the red and Rodrigues rail in 1998, stating that some of the features uniting them and some other rails were associated with the loss of flight rather than common descent. ",0
1910,He also suggested that the grouping of the red and Rodrigues rail into the same genus may have been influenced by their geographical distribution.  ,1
1911,The French palaeontologist CeÌcile Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera in 1999.  ,1
1912,"Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. ",0
1913,"According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume in 2008, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. ",0
1914,"These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.  ",1
1915,"In 2019, Hume supported the distinction of the two genera, and cited the relation between the extinct Mauritius owl and the Rodrigues owl as another example of the diverging evolutionary paths on these islands. ",0
1916,"He stated that the relationships of the red and Rodrigues rails was more unclear than that of other extinct Mascarene rails, with many of their distinct features being related to flightlessness and modifications to their jaws due to their diet, suggesting long time isolation. ",0
1917,"He suggested their ancestors could have arrived on the Mascarenes during the middle Miocene at the earliest, but it may have happened more recently. ",0
1918,"The speed of which these features evolved may also have been affected by gene flow, resource availability, and climate events, and flightlessness can evolve rapidly in rails, as well as repeatedly within the same groups, as seen in for example ",0
1919,"Dryolimnas, so the distinctness of the red and Rodrigues rails may not have taken long to evolve (some other specialised rails evolved in less than 1â3 million years). ",0
1920,"Hume suggested that the two rails were probably related to Dryolimnas, but their considerably different morphology made it difficult to establish how. ",0
1921,"In general, rails are adept at colonising islands, and can become flightless within few generations in suitable environments, for example without predators, yet this also makes them vulnerable to human activities.  ",1
1922,"From the subfossil bones, illustrations and descriptions, it is known that the red rail was a flightless bird, somewhat larger than a chicken. ",0
1923,"Subfossil specimens range in size, which may indicate sexual dimorphism, as is common among rails.  ",1
1924,"It was about 35â40 cm (14â16 in) long, and the male may have weighed 1.3 kg (2.9 lb) and the female 1 kg (2.2 lb).  ",1
1925,"Its plumage was reddish brown all over, and the feathers were fluffy and hairlike; the tail was not visible in the living bird and the short wings likewise also nearly disappeared in the plumage. ",0
1926,"It had a long, slightly curved, brown bill, and some illustrations suggest it had a nape crest.  ",1
1927,"The bird perhaps resembled a lightly built kiwi, and it has also been likened to a limpkin, both in appearance and behaviour.   ",1
1928,"The cranium of the red rail was the largest among Mascarene rails, and was compressed from top to bottom in side view. ",0
1929,"The premaxilla that comprised most of the upper bill was long (nearly 47% longer than the cranium) and narrow, and ended in a sharp point. ",0
1930,"The narial (nostril) openings were 50% of the rostrum's length, and prominent, elongate foramina (openings) ran almost to the front edge of the narial opening. ",0
1931,"The mandibular rostrum of the lower jaw was long, with the length of the mandibular symphysis (the area where the halves of the mandible meet) being about 79% of the cranium's length. ",0
1932,"The mandible had large, deep set foramina, which ran almost up to a deep sulcus (furrow). ",0
1933,"Hume examined all available upper beaks in 2019, and while he found no differences in curvature, he thought the differences in length was most likely due to sexual dimorphism.  ",1
1934,"The scapula (shoulder blade) was wide in side view, and the coracoid was comparatively short, with a wide shaft.  ",1
1935,"The sternum (breast bone) and humerus (upper arm bone) were small, indicating that it had lost the power of flight. ",0
1936,"The humerus was 60â66 mm (2.4â2.6 in), and its shaft was strongly curved from top to bottom. ",0
1937,The ulna (lower arm bone) was short and strongly arched from top to bottom. ,0
1938,"Its legs were long and slender for such a large bird, but the pelvis was very wide, robust, and compact, and was 60 mm (2.4 in) in length. ",0
1939,"The femur (thigh-bone) was very robust, 69â71 mm (2.7â2.8 in) long, and the upper part of the shaft was strongly arched. ",0
1940,"The tibiotarsus (lower leg bone) was large and robust, especially the upper and lower ends, and was 98â115 mm (3.9â4.5 in) long. ",0
1941,"The tarsometatarsus (ankle bone) was large and robust, and 79 mm (3.1 in) long.   ",1
1942,"The red rail differed from the Rodrigues rail in having a proportionately shorter humerus, a narrower and longer skull, and having shorter and higher nostrils. ",0
1943,"The red rail was also larger, with somewhat smaller wings, but their leg proportions were similar.  ",1
1944,"The Dutch ornithologist Marc Herremans suggested in 1989 that the red and Rodrigues rails were neotenic, with juvenile features such as weak pectoral apparatuses and downy plumage.   ",1
1945,Mundy visited Mauritius in 1638 and described the red rail as follows: ,0
1946,"A Mauritius henne, a Fowle as bigge as our English hennes, of a yellowish Wheaten Colour, of which we only got one. ",0
1947,"Feathered all over, butte on their wings they are soe Few and smalle that they cannot with them raise themselves From the ground. ",0
1948,"There is a pretty way of taking them with a red cap, but this of ours was taken with a stick. ",0
1949,"They bee very good Meat, and are also Cloven footed, soe that they can Neyther Fly nor Swymme.  ",1
1950,"Another English traveller, John Marshall, described the bird as follows in 1668: Here are also great plenty of Dodos or red hens which are larger a little than our English henns, have long beakes and no, or very little Tayles. ",0
1951,"Their fethers are like down, and their wings so little that it is not able to support their bodies; but they have long leggs and will runn very fast, and that a man shall not catch them, they will turn so about in the trees. ",0
1952,"They are good meate when roasted, tasting something like a pig, and their skin like pig skin when roosted, being hard.  ",1
1953,", the Hoefnagel painging from ca. 1610 and the sketches from the Gelderland ship's journal from 1601 attributted to Laerle, where brought to attention in ",0
1954,"It is the only unequivocal coloured depiction of the species, showing the plumage as reddish brown, but it is unknown whether it was based on a stuffed or living specimen.  ",1
1955,"The bird had most likely been brought alive to Europe, as it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. ",0
1956,It had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals painted for the same series.  ,1
1957,"The painting was discovered in the emperor's collection and published in 1868 by Georg von Frauenfeld, along with a painting of a dodo from the same collection and artist.   ",1
1958,This specimen is thought to have been the only red rail that ever reached Europe.  ,1
1959,"The red rail depicted in the Gelderland journal appears to have been stunned or killed, and the sketch is the earliest record of the species. ",0
1960,"It is the only illustration of the species drawn on Mauritius, and according to Hume, the most accurate depiction. ",0
1961,"The image was sketched with pencil and finished in ink, but details such as a deeper beak and the shoulder of the wing are only seen in the underlying sketch.   ",1
1962,"In addition, there are three rather crude black-and-white sketches, but differences in them were enough for some authors to suggest that each image depicted a distinct species, leading to the creation of several scientific names which are now synonyms.  ",1
1963,"An illustration in van den Broecke's 1646 account (based on his stay on Mauritius in 1617) shows a red rail next to a dodo and a one-horned goat, but is not referenced in the text. ",0
1964,"An illustration in Herbert's 1634 account (based on his stay in 1629) shows a red rail between a broad-billed parrot and a dodo, and has been referred to as ""extremely crude"" by Hume. ",0
1965,"As suggested by Greenway, there are also depictions of what appears to be a red rail in three of the Dutch artist Roelant Savery's paintings.  ",1
1966,"In his famous Edwards' Dodo painting from 1626, a rail-like bird is seen swallowing a frog behind the dodo, but Hume has doubted this identification and that of red rails in other Savery paintings, suggesting may instead show Eurasian bitterns.   ",1
1967,"In 1977, the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley noted a bird resembling a red rail figured in the Italian artist Jacopo Bassano's painting Arca di NoeÌ (""Noah's Ark"") from ca. 1570. ",0
1968,"Cheke pointed out that it is doubtful that a Mauritian bird could have reached Italy this early, but the attribution may be inaccurate, as Bassano had four artist sons who used the same name.  A similar bird is also seen in the Flemish artist Jan Brueghel the Elder's Noah's Ark painting.  ",1
1969,Hume concluded that these paintings also show Eurasian bitterns rather than red rails.  ,1
1970,Contemporary accounts are repetitive and do not shed much light on the life history of the red rail. ,0
1971,"Based on fossil localities, the bird widely occurred on Mauritius, in montane, lowland, and coastal habitats.  ",1
1972,"The shape of the beak indicates it could have captured reptiles and invertebrates, and the differences in bill length suggests the sexes foraged on items of different sizes. ",0
1973,"It may also have scavenged breeding colonies of birds and nesting-sites of tortoises, as the Rodrigues rail did.   ",1
1974,"No contemporary accounts were known to mention the red rail's diet, until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015, where he mentioned that the bird ""scratches in the earth with its sharp claws like a fowl to find food such as worms under the fallen leaves. ",0
1975,"Milne-Edwards suggested that since the tip of the red rail's bill was sharp and strong, it fed by crushing molluscs and other shells, like oystercatchers do. ",0
1976,"There were many endemic land-snails on Mauritius, including the large, extinct Tropidophora carinata, and subfossil shells have been found with puncture holes on their lower surfaces, which suggest predation by birds, probably matching attacks from the beak of the red rail. ",0
1977,"The similarly sized weka of New Zealand punctures shells of land-snails to extract meat, but can also swallow Powelliphanta snails; Hume suggested the red rail was also able to swallow snails whole. ",0
1978," Hume noted that the front of the red rail's jaws were pitted with numerous foramina, running from the nasal aperture to almost the tip of the premaxilla. ",0
1979,"Since Pretorius mentioned the red rail searched for worms in leaf-litter, Hume suggested this could refer to nemertean and planarian worms; Mauritius has endemic species of these groups which live in leaf-litter and rotten wood. ",0
1980,"He could also have referred to the now extinct worm-snake Madatyphlops cariei, which was up to 200 mm (7.9 in) long, and probably lived in leaf-litter like its relatives do.   ",1
1981,"These were mostly oval, varying in depth and inclination, and became shallower hindward from the tip. ",0
1982,"Similar foramina can be seen in probing birds, such as kiwis, ibises, and sandpipers. ",0
1983,"While unrelated, these three bird groups share a foraging strategy; they probe for live food beneath substrate, and have elongated bills with clusters of mechanoreceptors concentrated at the tip. ",0
1984,Their bill-tips allow them to detect buried prey by sensing cues from the substrate. ,0
1985,"The foramina on the bill of the red rail were comparable to those in other probing rails with long bills (such as the extinct snipe-rail), though not as concentrated on the tip, and the front end of the bill's curvature also began at the front of the nasal opening (as well as the same point in the mandible). ",0
1986,"The bill's tip was thereby both strong and very sensitive, and a useful tool for probing for invertebrates.  ",1
1987,"A 1631 letter probably by the Dutch lawyer Leonardus Wallesius (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) uses word-play to refer to the animals described, with red rails supposedly being an allegory for soldiers:   ",1
1988,"The soldiers were very small and moved slowly, so that we could catch them easily with our hands. ",0
1989,"Their armor was their mouth, which was very sharp and pointed; they used it instead of a dagger, were very cowardly and nervous; they did not behave as soldiers at all, and walked in a disorderly manner, one here, the other there, and did not show any faithfulness towards one another.  ",1
1990,"While it was swift and could escape when chased, it was easily lured by waving a red cloth, which they approached to attack; a similar behaviour was noted in its relative, the Rodrigues rail. ",0
1991,"The birds could then be picked up, and their cries when held would draw more individuals to the scene, as the birds, which had evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, were curious and not afraid of humans.[22 ",0
1992,"] Herbert described its behaviour towards red cloth in 1634: The hens in eating taste like parched pigs, if you see a flocke of twelve or twenties, shew them a red cloth, and with their utmost silly fury they will altogether flie upon it, and if you strike downe one, the rest are as good as caught, not budging an iot till they be all destroyed.  ",1
1993,"Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man heavily damaged the ecosystem, making it hard to reconstruct. ",0
1994,"Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains today due to deforestation.  ",1
1995,"The red rail lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. ",0
1996,"Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. ",0
1997,"The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and ReÌunion, but became extinct in both islands. ",0
1998,"Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.  ",1
1999,"Though Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island.  ",1
2000,"The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company.  ",1
2001,"To the sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. ",0
2002,"The dodo was sometimes considered rather unpalatable, but the red rail was a popular gamebird for the Dutch and French settlers. ",0
2003,The reports dwell upon the varying ease with which the bird could be caught according to the hunting method and the fact that when roasted it was considered similar to pork.  ,1
2004,"The last detailed account of the red rail was by the German pastor Johann Christian Hoffmann, on Mauritius in the early 1670s,  who described a hunt as follows:  there is also] a particular sort of bird known as toddaerschen which is the size of an ordinary hen. ",1
2005,"To catch them] you take a small stick in the right hand and wrap the left hand in a red rag, showing this to the birds, which are generally in big flocks; these stupid animals precipitate themselves almost without hesitation on the rag. ",0
2006,I cannot truly say whether it is through hate or love of this colour. ,0
2007,"Once they are close enough, you can hit them with the stick, and then have only to pick them up. ",0
2008,"Once you have taken one and are holding it in your hand, all the others come running up as it sic] to its aid and can be offered the same fate. ",1
2009,"Hoffman's account refers to the red rail by the German version of the Dutch name originally applied to the dodo, ""dod-aers"", and John Marshall used ""red hen"" interchangeably with ""dodo"" in 1668.  ",1
2010,Milne-Edwards suggested that early travellers may have confused young dodos with red rails.  ,1
2011,The British ornithologist Alfred Newton (brother of Edward) suggested in 1868 that that the name of the dodo was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct.  ,1
2012,"Cheke suggested in 2008 that all post 1662 references to ""dodos"" therefore refer to the rail instead.  ",1
2013,"A 1681 account of a ""dodo"", previously thought to have been the last, mentioned that the meat was ""hard"", similar to the description of red hen meat.  ",1
2014,"The British writer Errol Fuller has also cast the 1662 ""dodo"" sighting in doubt, as the reaction to distress cries of the birds mentioned matches what was described for the red rail.  ",1
2015,"In 2020, Cheke and the British researcher Jolyon C. Parish suggested that all mentions of dodos after the mid-17th century instead referred to red rails, and that the dodo had disappeared due to predation by feral pigs during a hiatus in settlement of Mauritius (1658â1664). ",0
2016,"The dodo's extinction therefore was not realised at the time, since new settlers had not seen real dodos, but as they expected to see flightless birds, they referred to the red rail by that name instead. ",0
2017,"Since red rails probably had larger clutches than dodos (as in other rails) and their eggs could be incubated faster, and their nests were perhaps concealed like those of the Rodrigues rail, they probably bred more efficiently, and were less vulnerable to pigs. ",0
2018," 230 years before Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the appearance of the red rail and the dodo led Mundy to speculate: Of these 2 sorts off fowl afforementionede, For oughtt wee yett know, Not any to bee Found out of this Iland, which lyeth aboutt 100 leagues From St. Lawrence. ",0
2019,"They may also have foraged from the digging, scraping and rooting of the pigs, as does the weka. ",1
2020,"A question may bee demaunded how they should bee here and Not elcewhere, beeing soe Farer From other land and can Neither fly or swymme; ",0
2021,"All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, all caused by human activities.  ",1
2022,"In addition to hunting pressure by humans, the fact that the red rail nested on the ground made it vulnerable to pigs and other introduced animals, which ate their eggs and young, probably contributing to its extinction, according to Cheke.  Hume pointed out that the red rail had coexisted with introduced rats since at least the 14th century, which did not appear to have affected them (as they seem to have been relatively common in the 1680s), and they were probably able to defend their nests (Dryolimnas rails have been observed killing rats, for example). ",1
2023,They also seemed to have managed to survive alongside humans as well as introduced pigs and crab-eating macaques.  ,1
2024,"Since the red rail was referred to by the names of the dodo in the late 1600s, it is uncertain which is the latest account of the latter.  ",1
2025,"When the French traveller FrancÌ§ois Leguat, who had become familiar with the Rodrigues rail in the preceding years, arrived on Mauritius in 1693, he remarked that the red rail had become rare. ",0
2026,"He was the last source to mention the bird, so it is assumed that it became extinct around 1700.   ",1
2027,"Feral cats, which are effective predators of ground-inhabiting birds, were established on Mauritius around the late 1680s (to control rats), and this has been cause for rapid disappearance of rails elsewhere, for example on Aldabra Atoll. ",0
2028,"The red warbler (Cardellina rubra) is a small passerine bird of the New World warbler family Parulidae endemic to the highlands of Mexico, north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. ",0
2029,"Being inquisitive and fearless, Hume suggested the red rail would have been easy prey for cats, and was thereby driven to extinction. ",1
2030,"It is closely related to, and forms a superspecies with, the pink-headed warbler of southern Mexico and Guatemala. ",0
2031,"There are three subspecies, found in disjunct populations, which differ primarily in the color of their ear patch and in the brightness and tone of their body plumage. ",0
2032,"The adult is bright red, with a white or gray ear patch, depending on the subspecies; young birds are pinkish-brown, with a whitish ear patch and two pale wingbars. ",0
2033,"May. The female lays three or four eggs in a domed nest, which she builds on the ground. ",0
2034,"Though she alone incubates the eggs, both sexes feed the young and remove fecal sacs from the nest. ",0
2035,"The red warbler is an insectivore, gleaning primarily in understory shrubs. ",0
2036,"Although this bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat destruction. ",0
2037,"English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science.  ",1
2038,"The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. ",0
2039,"Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra.  ",1
2040,"Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. ",0
2041,"In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.  ",1
2042,The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. ,0
2043,"Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific.  ",1
2044,"Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra).  ",1
2045,A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each other's closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. ,0
2046,"The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina,  a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ",1
2047,"""Red warbler"" has been designated the official name by the IOC.  ",1
2048,"The genus name Cardellina is the diminutive of the Italian cardella, a regional name for the European goldfinch,  while its specific name, rubra, is Latin for ""red"".  ",1
2049,"The red warbler is a small passerine, measuring 12.5â13.5 cm (4.9â5.3 in) in length,  and weighing from 7.6 to 8.7 g (0.27 to 0.31 oz).  ",1
2050,"As an adult, it is red overall, with either a white or dark gray (depending on the subspecies) auricular patch on each side of its head. ",0
2051,"Its wings and tail are slightly darker, dusky red,  and edged in pinkish-red.  ",1
2052,"Its legs are a dull red-brown, and its thin bill is pinkish-gray  with a dark tip.  ",1
2053,"Plumage varies little between the sexes, although the female tends to be a little duller or more orange-tinged. ",0
2054,"Adult pairs separate and moult fully from August, after the breeding season.  ",1
2055,The adult red warbler is hard to confuse with any other bird species in its range; the scarlet tanager and summer tanager have similar mostly-red plumage but are larger with thick conical bills.  ,1
2056,"As a juvenile, the red warbler is pinkish-brown with a whitish auricular patch. ",0
2057,"Its darker wings and tail show pinkish-cinnamon edges, with two paler wingbars on the former.  ",1
2058,"The red warbler has several common calls, including a high, thin tsii and a stronger pseet. ",0
2059,"Its song is a mix of short trills and richer warbles, interspersed with high-pitched chips.  ",1
2060,"Unlike other species in the same habitat zone, it tends to sing only during bright morning hours during the breeding season. ",0
2061," Endemic to the highlands of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the red warbler has three disjunct populations that correspond to the three subspecies: from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit, from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca, and from Guerrero into southern Oaxaca in the Sierra Madre del Sur.   ",1
2062,"It does not sing â and even its calling frequency decreases â in cloudy weather, regardless of season. ",1
2063,"It is fairly common to common in the country's interior and on adjacent slopes, where it occurs at elevations ranging from 1,800 to 3,900 metres (5,900 to 12,800 ft) above sea level; it does not occur along either coast.   ",1
2064,"It is an altitudinal migrant, moving from higher humid or semi-humid pine, pine-oak and fir forests in the breeding season to lower elevations, often in oak forests, in the winter.   ",1
2065,"It is among the most common of the small birds in its woodland habitat, second only to the golden-crowned kinglet in fir forests in one study  and the third most common warbler in oak-conifer woodlands in another.  ",1
2066,"Though the species was reported to have been collected in Texas in the late 19th century, the record's location was not widely believed, and there is no strong evidence that it ever occurred there.  ",1
2067,"It has strayed as far north as southeastern Arizona, where a bird was found on Mount Lemmon in 2018.  ",1
2068,"Though it occasionally joins mixed-species flocks, the red warbler is more typically found alone or in pairs.  ",1
2069,"Youngsters probably choose mates in the autumn of their first year, and pairs remain together year-round,  except during severe weather and during post-breeding molt.  ",1
2070,"The red warbler breeds primarily in early spring, from February until May,  though at least one nest containing young has been found as late as the end of June.  ",1
2071,"By late February, the male establishes a territory that averages about 40 square metres, defending it with song. ",0
2072,Other males may intrude by silently flying in at a height of around 3 m (10 ft) and back to their own territory. ,0
2073,"Deep incursions result in combat, after which the interloper usually leaves. ",0
2074,"Beginning in mid-March, the male courts the female by chasing her through the undergrowth.  ",1
2075,The pair then perch together while the male sings and the female calls softly.  ,1
2076,"The female alone builds the nest,  a task which typically takes 4â6 days.  ",1
2077,"She chooses a sunlit area, such as an area of windfall, the brushy edge of a trail or water course,  or a small clearing,  for its location. ",1
2078,"Tightly woven of plant material, the nest is hidden in ground vegetation and anchored to the stalks of surrounding vegetation.  ",1
2079,"The nest, which is usually oven-shaped with a side or upward-facing entrance,  measures roughly 15 cm (6 in) wide by 18 cm (7 in) long by 11 cm (4.5 in) high.  ",1
2080,"Bulky and untidy on the outside, it is typically constructed primarily of dead pine needles and dead grass, though gray lichens, green moss, dead leaves,  shreds of bark and tips of fern fronds are also used;  most of these materials are gathered from the ground close to the nest, though some is picked from low branches or further away.  ",1
2081,"A few nests are only cups, lacking the roof of the more typical structures.  ",1
2082,"Inside, the nest is tidy and compact,  lined with fine grasses and plant fluff,  which is generally gathered some distance from the nest.  ",1
2083,"Early in the breeding season, there may be a gap of as many as 11 days between the completion of the nest and the laying of the first egg. ",0
2084,"Later in the season, this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready.  ",1
2085,"The female normally lays three eggs, though clutches of up to four have been recorded.  ",1
2086,"The eggs, which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots  or white with cinnamon and rust spots densely ringing the larger end of the egg,  measure 16â17 mm (0.63â0.67 in) by 13 mm (0.51 in)  and weigh 1â1.4 g (0.035â0.049 oz). ",1
2087,The female alone incubates the eggs for 16 days; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch. ,0
2088,"She sits facing the back wall of the nest, with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening. ",0
2089,"She sits tight at the approach of danger, typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest.  ",1
2090,"Both adults feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs,  though the female removes far more than the male does.  ",1
2091,"The parents move deceptively when approaching the nest, foraging â or pretending to forage â in nearby vegetation. ",0
2092,"They stay only a few seconds in any one spot, including at the nest, making it more difficult for a predator to locate the young. ",0
2093,"Nestlings make a rapid, high-pitched peeping call as an adult approaches carrying food.  ",1
2094,"Young birds are fully grown three weeks after fledging, upon which time they are driven off by their parents.  ",1
2095,"It gleans primarily in understory shrubs at low to middle levels,  moving slowly and deliberately through more open areas of the vegetation,  and feeding with quick jabs into cracks in bark and pine needle clusters.  ",1
2096,"It sometimes hovers briefly to feed at pine needle clusters, a foraging technique known as ""hover gleaning"".  ",1
2097,"Though it lacks any obvious adaptations for climbing, it regularly does so in its search for prey items on bark and epiphytes on branches,  often hanging head-down as it probes.  ",1
2098,"In areas of deciduous growth, it typically flycatches, making brief aerial sorties from a perch in pursuit of flying insects. ",0
2099,"While it seldom associates with mixed-species flocks, it often feeds alongside other birds with no signs of conflict, displaying no hostility towards other speciesâsuch as the slate-throated whitestart (Myioborus miniatus)âwith which it competes. ",0
2100,It has been observed chasing off a flycatcher of the genus Empidonax. ,0
2101,"Its foraging area is quite small, often amounting to only a few dozen square meters (several hundred square feet) per day. ",0
2102,"Late in the afternoon, its rate of foraging declines, and it rests, often taking brief naps, in the forest understory. ",0
2103,"Though it does not generally feed after sunset, it may do so to take advantage of transient food sources, such as hatching Neuroptera.  ",1
2104,"The red warbler is presumably hunted by small hawks such as the sharp-shinned hawk, and its nest raided by wrens, rodents, raccoons, feral cats and snakes.  ",1
2105,"Isospora cardellinae is a protozoan species that has been isolated from a red warbler from Nevado de Toluca National Park, Mexico. ",0
2106,It is a parasite that lives in cells in the villi of the bird's small intestine.  ,1
2107,"In the 16th century, Friar Bernardino de SahaguÌn had reported that a red bird matching the description of the red warbler was regarded as inedible by the Aztecs. ",0
2108,Researchers Patricia Escalante and John W. Daly isolated two alkaloids in preliminary investigations of the feathers.  ,1
2109,The presence of these alkaloids render the bird unpalatable; humans find it inedible.  ,1
2110,The red warbler is currently rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ,0
2111,"Though there is evidence that its numbers are decreasing, the decline has not been precipitous (that is, under a 30% decline over ten years or three generations), and the population remains quite large, estimates ranging from 50,000 to 499,999 birds.  ",1
2112,"The forested areas in which it occurs include some of the most threatened habitats in Mexico; logging, agricultural expansion, firewood gathering, road building, tourist development, overgrazing and intensive urbanization are among the many things contributing to the destruction of the forests.  ",1
2113,"There is some evidence that selective logging in pine forests may actually favor this species, which prefers more open, sunlit areas in which to breed.[20The red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) is a passerine bird native to southern Australia. ",0
2114,"At 33â37 cm (13â14 1â2 in) in length, it is the second largest species of Australian honeyeater. ",0
2115,"It has mainly  grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red wattles on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. ",0
2116,"The species is found in southeast Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodlands, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. ",0
2117,"Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. ",0
2118,"It is one of the largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. ",0
2119,"It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. ",0
2120,"Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one or two broods a year. ",0
2121,"Although it has declined in places from land-clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. ",0
2122,"The red wattlebird was first described as the wattled bee-eater by the Irish surgeon and naturalist John White in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.  ",1
2123,"He wrote that it was the ""size of a missel thrush, but much larger in proportion"".  ",1
2124,"The taxonomic descriptions in White's book are believed to have been written by the English naturalist George Shaw,   who is generally credited as the author by subsequent authorities.   ",1
2125,"The specific epithet, carunculata, was introduced later in the same year by John Latham.   ",1
2126,"The word is derived from caruncula, Latin for 'a small piece of flesh'.  ",1
2127,Both Shaw and Latham assigned the red wattlebird to the genus Merops. ,0
2128,The species was moved to Anthochaera in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield.   ,1
2129,"The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek anthos 'flower, bloom' and khairoÌ 'enjoy'.  ",1
2130,"Common names include gillbird,  gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o clock, and chock.  ",1
2131,"Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names by the local indigenous people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like the calls they make). ",0
2132,"Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird).  ",1
2133,"In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people knew it as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko.  ",1
2134,"The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it noggal,  and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as rungkan.  ",1
2135,"There are three recognised subspecies,  though there is a zone of intermediate birds across western Victoria and eastern South Australia, bordered by western Port Phillip Bay to the east, Mount Lofty Ranges to the west, and Little and Big Desert national parks to the north.  ",1
2136,The differences in plumage are not generally prominent enough to be noticeable in the field.  ,1
2137,"Analysis of DNA showed that the closest relative of the red wattlebird is the yellow wattlebird of Tasmania, the pair splitting from the ancestor of the regent honeyeaterâtheir next closest relative.  ",1
2138,"Honeyeaters are related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.  ",1
2139,"The sexes of the red wattlebird are similar in size and plumage, the length of the adult male ranging from 33 to 37 centimetres (13 to 15 in) and the adult female from 34 to 37 centimetres (13 to 15 in).  With an average weight of 100â120 grams (3.5â4.2 oz),  the red wattlebird is one of the largest nectar-feeding birds in the world,  and the second largest species of honeyeater native to Australia, eclipsed only by the yellow wattlebird.  ",1
2140,"The crown, forehead and upper lores (area between the eyes and nostrils) are dark brown, streaked with pale brown at the front of the crown and white at the rear of the crown. ",0
2141,"The nape (back of the neck) is slightly paler brown, with white streaks. ",0
2142,"A whitish triangular marking covers the lower lores and anterior ear covert feathers, bordered below by a dark brown stripe from the lower mandible down to the wattle and around to behind the eye. ",0
2143,"The distinctive pinkish-red wattles dangle from the lower rear corner of the ear coverts on either side of the neck, and there is a sliver of pink bare skin at the lower border of the white patch on the face.  ",1
2144,"The chest and belly are streaked white, and there is a bright yellow patch towards the tail.  ",1
2145,"The strong legs and feet are pink or pinkish-brown, and the downward-curving bill is black.  ",1
2146,"The average dimensions of the bill are 23.5 millimetres (0.93 in) long, 6.7 millimetres (0.26 in) wide, and 6.8 millimetres (0.27 in) high at its base.  ",1
2147,"The gape is grey-black, while the inside of the mouth is orange.  ",1
2148,"In common with other honeyeaters, the red wattlebird has a long, specialized tongue to extract nectar from flowers.  ",1
2149,"The tongue can extend well beyond the tip of the bill, and is divided at the end to form a brush-like structure with over a hundred bristles that soak up nectar by capillary action.  ",1
2150,"The red wattlebird begins moulting after the breeding season, starting with the primary flight feathers in November or December, and finishing between the following March and ",0
2151,"May. The feathers of the breast, back, median and lesser covert feathers are moulted before those of the crown, remiges, and rectrices.  ",1
2152,"Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown, and much less yellow on the belly. ",0
2153,They moult into first immature plumage within a few months of leaving the nest. ,0
2154,"First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.  ",1
2155,"The red wattlebird is hard to confuse with any other species, though in poor visibility it might be mistaken for the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, or little or western wattlebirds.  ",1
2156,"Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, producing a range of raucous calls. ",0
2157,"Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male producing a loud cackle and the female a whistling call.  ",1
2158,The male's cackle is loudest between 1 and 3 kHz frequency. ,0
2159,"A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. ",0
2160,"Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. ",0
2161,"The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles that may or may not ascend in tone, and are repeated 3â4 times.  ",1
2162,Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4â5 harmonics. ,0
2163,"Red wattlebirds utter two types of alarm calls, alternating between them while mobbing other animals. ",0
2164,One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9 kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. ,0
2165,The other is a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1â2.2 kHz.  ,1
2166,"They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from the vicinity of the nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.  ",1
2167,"The red wattlebird is found in southeast Queensland, where it occurs south of Noosa and Cooloola, becoming more common south of Brisbane and Toowoomba. ",0
2168,"Further south into New South Wales it is found most places east of (and including) the Great Dividing Range and stretching west to the southern North-West Plain, Central Western Slopes and eastern Riverina, and is an occasional visitor to points along the Murray River valley. ",0
2169,"It is found across Victoria, though is uncommon in the northwest of the state. ",0
2170,"In South Australia, Devonborough Downs Station, Manunda, Wilpena Pound and Nullarbor Station mark the northern limits of its range. ",0
2171,"There are scattered records from the Nullarbor Plain, but the species is common in Western Australia west of  125 Â°E and south of 29 Â°S.  ",1
2172,"The red wattlebird has become more common in some localities, such as the Sunraysia district in the 1960s, and Nambucca Heads and Lefevre Peninsula in the 1980s.  ",1
2173,"The red wattlebird is a rare vagrant to New Zealand, with confirmed records at Matakana in 1865 and Rohutu, Taranaki, in 1885, and a third unconfirmed report from Motupiko in 1938.  ",1
2174,"The red wattlebird appears to be a permanent resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known. ",0
2175,It appears to be partly migratory in Western Australia and the north coast of New South Wales. ,0
2176,"In southeastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it appears to move to lower altitudes for winter.  ",1
2177,"For instance, birds vacate the Brindabella Range over the cooler months.  ",1
2178,"Overall, little pattern is discernible in the species' movements, though red wattlebirds appear to move to feed on populations of flowering banksias and eucalypts, such as winter-flowering banksias in Perth over the cooler months.  Large numbers arrive in  time to feed on flowering native apples (Angophora) in Mudgee and Cobbora districts in central-western New South Wales, and on white box (Eucalyptus albens) at Barrington in central-northern New South Wales.  ",1
2179,A mainly resident population on the Swan Coastal Plain near Perth is supplemented during winter by more arriving from inland areas. ,0
2180,"South of Perth, red wattlebirds are more locally nomadic, moving to new patches of blooming wildflowers. ",0
2181,"East of Perth in areas around Kellerberin, Kwolyin, and Nangeenan, the red wattlebird is present from late autumn to spring, breeding in August and September. ",0
2182,"Open sclerophyll forest and woodland, generally dominated by eucalypts, is the most common habitat of the species. ",0
2183,It is more common in forests with ample shrubby or grassy understory. ,0
2184,"It is less commonly encountered in shrubland, heath, or margins of wet sclerophyll forest. ",0
2185,"Within urban areas, it is abundant in parks and reserves, gardens and golf courses, as well as orchards and vineyards. ",0
2186,"It occasionally ventures into subtropical, semi-arid or subalpine regions, and has been found up to 1,900 m (6,000 ft) above sea level.  ",1
2187,The red wattlebird is rarer in forests that have been affected by dieback (infection by the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi).  ,1
2188,"A loud and active bird, the red wattlebird is found in pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the breeding season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. ",0
2189,"It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above the level of the tree canopy.  ",1
2190,"The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.  ",1
2191,"Aggressive and territorial, the red wattlebird defends its nest and sources of food against other birds. ",0
2192,"It either calls at, snaps at the tails of, or flies at other birds, sometimes scuffling with members of the same species or other large honeyeaters in the air.  ",1
2193,Displacement is a dominant display in which a red wattlebird will land on a perch that has been immediately vacated by another bird. ,0
2194,"A smaller red wattlebird adopts a horizontal appeasement posture side-on to the aggressor in which it lowers its head, flutters its wings and edges closer to the other bird.  ",1
2195,"As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob and chase larger species, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds, currawongs, the black-faced cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae), the olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), crows, ravens, the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), and even small raptors like the collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus). ",1
2196,"The red wattlebird breeds throughout its range, with nesting taking place between July and December, though occasionally outside these months, if conditions are favourable. ",0
2197,"The nest is a cup-shaped structure formed from sticks and leaves, lined with bark, grass, and hair,  between 2 and 16 metres (7 and 50 ft) above ground, usually in the forked branches of a treeâgenerally a eucalypt.  ",1
2198,The nest is usually located centrally rather than on the periphery of a tree.  ,1
2199,"A study in Eastwood State Forest, near Armidale in New South Wales, found that red wattlebirds preferred to nest in manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) and apple box (E. bridgesiana).  ",1
2200,A clutch of two or three pale brown- and lavender-spotted pinkish eggs are normally laid. ,0
2201,"They measure 33 mm Ã 22 mm (1 1â4 in Ã 7â8 in), and are a tapered oval in shape.  ",1
2202,"The eggs are normally incubated by both parents, but sometimes just by the female. ",0
2203,"The chicks are born almost naked, with a small amount of grey down on their head and body.  ",1
2204,"They are mostly brooded by the female, but sometimes the male will also brood. ",0
2205,"The nestlings are fed by both parents, and occasionally immature birds will contribute. ",0
2206,"They fledge 15â20 days after hatching, and both parents continue to feed them for a further 2â3 weeks.  ",1
2207,"Young are given manna (crystallised plant sap) and insects, such as beetles, bugs, and flies.  ",1
2208,"The red wattlebird is predominantly a nectar-feeder,  foraging mostly in trees; in particular, climbing along branches (rather than the trunk) and probing flower-heads with its bill.  ",1
2209,One study in Bondi State Forest in southern New South Wales revealed that the species foraged at a height of 5.9 Â± 5.8 m (19 Â± 19 ft).  ,1
2210,"They seldom look for food on the ground, though do so to feed on shrubs such as the cats paw (Anigozanthos humilis).  ",1
2211,"The red wattlebird prioritises visiting flowers that produce a lot of nectar, such as those of eucalypts, banksias, grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea), and emu bushes (Eremophila).  ",1
2212,"It often prefers plants with easy access to nectar, rather than those with tubular flowers (and thus difficult-to-access nectar).  ",1
2213,"The red wattlebird seeks out yellow flower-heads of holly-leaved banksia (Banksia ilicifolia), which have much higher nectar content than the more mature red flower-heads.  ",1
2214,"The species forages much more often in native than exotic plants,  though the introduced coral tree (Erythrina) is popular.  ",1
2215,"In addition to nectar, it takes insects and other small creatures, usually by hawking, and it also feeds on berries and other fruit.  ",1
2216,A field study in the Mount Lofty Ranges found that it spent twice as much time feeding on nectar compared to insects.  ,1
2217,"One field study found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar concentrations in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. ",0
2218,"However, this could have been because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active.  ",1
2219,"In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.  ",1
2220,"In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages more often on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some preference for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), if grey gum is not present. ",0
2221,Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) where both species are present.  ,1
2222,"The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.  ",1
2223,"A field study, conducted in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island, found red wattlebirds to be territorial around a rich source of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. ",0
2224,"This indicated that the species would exclude other species, if food was scarce.  ",1
2225,"In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive when there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias, but were less so at lean or abundant times.  ",1
2226,"The red wattlebird has a brush-tipped tongue, with a  17 mm (5â8 in) long segment bearing around 120 individual bristles. ",0
2227,"It feeds by placing the bill in a flower and inserting the tongue into its nectar chamber, drawing the nectar up by capillary action. ",0
2228,The bristles increase the surface area of the tongue available for the uptake of nectar.  ,1
2229,"The nests of red wattlebirds are often parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus), and less commonly by the Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis). ",0
2230,"Nest predators include the brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus), black falcon (Falco subniger), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), domestic cat, and snakes.  ",1

Species of bird louse that have been recorded on the red wattlebird include Menacanthus eurysternus, and members of the genera Brueelia, Myrsidea and Philopterus.  ",1
2232,"Red wattlebirds are adversely impacted by land and undergrowth clearing, and have vanished from some habitats thus altered.  ",1
2233,"Despite this, they are classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid.  ",1
2234,"Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, as well as being hit by cars on roads.  ",1
2235,"In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat.  ",1
2236,"Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport,  or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards.  ",1
2237,"On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, loquats, apples, pears, and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.  ",1

2241,The ReÌunion ibis or ReÌunion sacred ibis (Threskiornis solitarius) is an extinct species of ibis that was endemic to the volcanic island of ReÌunion in the Indian Ocean. ,0
2242,"The first subfossil remains were found in 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. ",0
2243,"Its closest relatives are the Malagasy sacred ibis, the African sacred ibis, and the straw-necked ibis. ",0
2244,"Travellers' accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries described a white bird on ReÌunion that flew with difficulty and preferred solitude, which was subsequently referred to as the ""ReÌunion solitaire"". ",0
2245,"In the mid 19th century, the old travellers' accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the dodo, due to one account specifically mentioning dodos on the island, and because 17th-century paintings of white dodos had recently surfaced. ",0
2246,"However, no fossils referable to dodo-like birds were ever found on ReÌunion, and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island. ",0
2247,"In the late 20th century, the discovery of ibis subfossils led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead. ",0
2248,"The idea that the ""solitaire"" and the subfossil ibis are identical was met with limited dissent, but is now widely accepted. ",0
2249,"Combined, the old descriptions and subfossils show that the ReÌunion ibis was mainly white, with this colour merging into yellow and grey. ",0
2250,The wing tips and plumes of ostrich-like feathers on its rear were black. ,0
2251,"The neck and legs were long, and the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis. ",0
2252,"It was more robust in build than its extant relatives, but was otherwise quite similar to them. ",0
2253,It would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length. ,0
2254,"Subfossil wingbones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities, a feature perhaps linked to seasonal fattening. ",0
2255,The diet of the ReÌunion ibis was worms and other items foraged from the soil. ,0
2256,"In the 17th century, it lived in mountainous areas, but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by introduced animals in the more accessible areas of the island. ",0
2257,"Visitors to ReÌunion praised its flavour, and therefore sought after its flesh. ",0
2258,These factors are believed to have driven the ReÌunion ibis to extinction by the early 18th century. ,0
2259,"The taxonomic history of the ReÌunion ibis is convoluted and complex, due to the ambiguous and meagre evidence that was available to scientists until the late 20th century. ",0
2260,"The supposed ""white dodo"" of ReÌunion is now believed to have been an erroneous conjecture based on the few contemporary reports which described the ReÌunion ibis, combined with paintings of white dodos from Mauritius by the Dutch painters Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn II (and derivatives) from the 17th century that surfaced in the 19th century.  ",1
2261,"The English Chief Officer John Tatton was the first to mention a specifically white bird on ReÌunion, in 1625. ",0
2262,"The French occupied the island from 1646 and onwards, and referred to this bird as the ""solitaire"". ",0
2263,"M. CarreÌ of the French East India Company described the ""solitaire"" in 1699, explaining the reason for its name:  I saw a kind of bird in this place which I have not found elsewhere; it is that which the inhabitants call the Oiseaux Solitaire for to be sure , it loves solitude and only frequents the most secluded places; one never sees two or more together; it is always alone. ",1
2264,"It is not unlike a turkey, if it did not have longer legs. ",0
2265,"The flesh is exquisite; it forms one of the best dishes in this country, and might form a dainty at our tables. ",0
2266,"We wished to keep two of these birds to send to France and present them to His Majesty, but as soon as they were on board ship, they died of melancholy, having refused to eat or drink.  ",1
2267,"FrancÌ§ois Leguat used the name ""solitaire"" for the Rodrigues solitaire, a Raphine bird (related to the dodo) he encountered on the nearby island of Rodrigues in the 1690s, but it is thought he borrowed the name from a 1689 tract by Marquis Henri Duquesne which mentioned the ReÌunion species. ",0
2268,Duquesne himself had probably based his own description on an earlier one.  ,1
2269,The two individuals CarreÌ attempted to send to the royal menagerie in France did not survive in captivity. ,0
2270,"Billiard claimed that the French administrator Bertrand-FrancÌ§ois MaheÌ de La Bourdonnais sent a ""solitaire"" to France from ReÌunion around 1740. ",0
2271,"Since the ReÌunion ibis is believed to have gone extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues solitaire.  ",1
2272,"The only contemporary writer who referred specifically to ""dodos"" inhabiting ReÌunion was the Dutch sailor Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe, though he did not mention their colouration:   ",1
2273,"There were also Dod-eersenold Dutch for dodos], which have small wings, and so far from being able to fly, they were so fat that they could scarcely walk, and when they tried to run, they dragged their under side along the ground.  ",1
2274,"When his journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving which is now known to have been copied after one of the dodos in the Flemish painter Roelant Savery's ""Crocker Art Gallery sketch"".  Since Bontekoe was shipwrecked and lost all his belongings after visiting ReÌunion in 1619, he may not have written his account until he returned to Holland, seven years later, which would put its reliability in question.  ",1
2275,"He may have concluded in hindsight that it was a dodo, finding what he saw similar to accounts of that bird.  ",1
2276,"In the 1770s, the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the dodo inhabited both Mauritius and ReÌunion for unclear reasons. ",0
2277,"He also combined accounts about the Rodrigues solitaire and a bird from Mauritius (""oiseau de Nazareth"", now thought to be a dodo), as well as the ""solitaire"" CarreÌ reported from ReÌunion under one ""solitaire"" section, indicating he believed there was both a dodo and ""solitaire"" on ReÌunion.  ",1
2278,"The English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland discussed the old descriptions of the ""solitaire"" in his 1848 book The Dodo and Its Kindred, and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire due to its colouration.  ",1
2279,"The Belgian scientist Edmond de SeÌlys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis solitarius for the ""solitaire"" in 1848, apparently making it the type species of the genus, in which he also included two other Mascarene birds only known from contemporary accounts, the red rail and the ReÌunion swamphen.  ",1
2280,"As the name Apterornis had already been used for a different bird by the English biologist Richard Owen, and the other former names were likewise invalid, Bonaparte coined the new binomial Ornithaptera borbonica in 1854 (Bourbon was the original French name for ReÌunion).  ",1
2281,"In 1854, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel placed the ""solitaire"" in the same genus as the dodo, and named it Didus apterornis.  ",1
2282,"He restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts, which resulted in an ibis or stork-like bird instead of a dodo.  ",1
2283,"In 1856, William Coker announced the discovery of a 17th-century ""Persian"" painting of a white dodo among waterfowl, which he had been shown in England. ",0
2284,"The artist was later identified as Pieter Withoos, and many prominent 19th-century naturalists subsequently assumed the image depicted the white ""solitaire"" of ReÌunion, a possibility originally proposed by ornithologist John Gould. ",0
2285,"Simultaneously, several similar paintings of white dodos by Pieter Holsteyn II were discovered in the Netherlands.  ",1
2286,"In 1869, the English ornithologist Alfred Newton argued that the Withoos' painting and engraving in Bontekoe's memoir depicted a living ReÌunion dodo that had been brought to Holland, while explaining its blunt beak as a result of beak trimming to prevent it from injuring humans. ",0
2287,"He also brushed aside the inconsistencies between the illustrations and descriptions, especially the long, thin beak implied by one contemporary account.  ",1
2288,"Newton's words particularly cemented the validity of this connection among contemporary peers, and several of them expanded on his views.  ",1
2289,"The Dutch zoologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested in 1917 that the discrepancies between the paintings and the old descriptions were due to the paintings showing a female, and that the species was, therefore, sexually dimorphic.  ",1
2290,"The British zoologist Walter Rothschild claimed in 1907 that the yellow wings might have been due to albinism in this particular specimen, since the old descriptions described these as black.  ",1
2291," Rothschild commissioned British artist Frederick William Frohawk to restore the ""solitaire"" as both a white dodo, based on the Withoos painting, and as a distinct bird based on the French traveller Sieur Dubois' 1674 description, for his 1907 book Extinct Birds.  ",1
2292,"By the early 20th century, many other paintings and even physical remains were claimed to be of white dodos, amid much speculation. ",1
2293,"In 1953, the Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that the old accounts and paintings represented two species, and referred to the white dodos of the paintings as Victoriornis imperialis, and the ""solitaire"" of the accounts as Ornithaptera solitarius.  Until the late 1980s, belief in the existence of a white dodo on ReÌunion was the orthodox view, and only a few researchers doubted the connection between the ""solitaire"" accounts and the dodo paintings. ",1
2294,"The American ornithologist James Greenway cautioned in 1958 that no conclusions could be made without solid evidence such as fossils, and that nothing indicated that the white dodos in the paintings had anything to do with ReÌunion. ",0
2295,"In 1970, the American ornithologist Robert W. Storer predicted that if any such remains were found, they would not belong to Raphinae like the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire (or even to the pigeon family like them).    ",1
2296,"The first subfossil bird remains on ReÌunion, the lower part of a tarsometatarsus, was found in 1974, and considered a new species of stork in the genus Ciconia by the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles in 1987. ",0
2297,"The remains were found in a cave, which indicated it had been brought there and eaten by early settlers. ",0
2298,"It was speculated that the remains could have belonged to a large, mysterious bird described by Leguat, and called ""Leguat's giant"" by some ornithologists. ",0
2299,"Leguat's giant"" is now thought to be based on a locally extinct population of greater flamingos.  ",1
2300,"Also in 1987, a subfossil tarsometatarsus of an ibis found in a cave was described as Borbonibis latipes by the French palaeontologists CeÌcile Mourer-ChauvireÌ and FrancÌ§ois Moutou, and thought related to the bald ibises of the genus Geronticus.  ",1
2301,"In 1994, Cowles concluded that the ""stork"" remains he had reported belonged to Borbonibis, since their tarsometatarsi were similar.  ",1
2302,"The 1987 discovery led the English biologist Anthony S. Cheke to suggest to one of the describers of Borbonibis that the subfossils may have been of the ""solitaire"".  ",1
2303,"In 1995, the French ecologist Jean-Michel Probst reported his discovery of a bird mandible during an excavation on ReÌunion the former year, and suggested it may have belonged to the ibis or the ""solitaire"".  ",1
2304,"In 1995, the describers of Borbonibis latipes suggested that it represented the ""ReÌunion solitaire"", and reassigned it to the ibis genus Threskiornis, now combined with the specific epithet solitarius from de SeÌlys-Longchamps' 1848 binomial for the ""solitaire"" (making Borbonibis latipes a junior synonym). ",0
2305,"The authors pointed out that the contemporary descriptions matched the appearance and behaviour of an ibis more than a member of the Raphinae, especially due to its comparatively short and straight mandible, and because ibis remains were abundant in some localities; it would be strange if contemporary writers never mentioned such a relatively common bird, whereas they mentioned most other species subsequently known from fossils.  ",1
2306,"The possible origin of the 17th-century white dodo paintings was examined, by the Spanish biologist Arturo Valledor de Lozoya in 2003, and independently by experts of Mascarene fauna Cheke and Julian Hume in 2004. ",0
2307,"The Withoos and Holsteyn paintings are clearly derived from each other, and Withoos likely copied his dodo from one of Holsteyn's works, since these were probably produced at an earlier date. ",0
2308,All later white dodo pictures are thought to be based on these paintings. ,0
2309,"According to the aforementioned writers, it appears these pictures were themselves derived from a whitish dodo in a previously unreported painting called Landscape with Orpheus and the Animals, produced by Roelant Savery c. 1611. ",0
2310,"The dodo was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a walghvogel (old Dutch for dodo) described as having a ""dirty off-white colouring"" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607â1611).  Savery's several later dodo images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen. ",1
2311,"Cheke and Hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism, and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from Mauritius and brought to Europe.  ",1
2312,"Valledor de Lozoya instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply due to artistic license.  ",1
2313,"In 2018, the British ornithologist Jolyon C. Parish and Cheke suggested that the painting was instead executed after 1614, or even after 1626, based on some of the motifs.  ",1
2314,"While many subfossil elements from throughout the skeleton have been assigned to the ReÌunion ibis, no remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on ReÌunion.  ",1
2315,"A few later sources have taken issue with the proposed ibis-identity of the ""solitaire"", and have even regarded the ""white dodo"" as a valid species.  ",1
2316,"The British writer Errol Fuller agrees that the 17th-century paintings do not depict ReÌunion birds, but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the ""solitaire"" accounts. ",0
2317,"Cheke and Hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere ""belief"" and ""hope"" in the existence of a dodo on the island.  ",1
2318,He notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time Europeans reached ReÌunion.   ,1
2319,"The volcanic island of ReÌunion is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each of their flightless Raphine species, are eight to ten million years old, and according to Cheke and Hume it is unlikely that either bird would have been capable of flying after five or more million years of adapting to the islands. ",0
2320,"Therefore, it is unlikely that ReÌunion could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands, and only flighted species on the island have relatives there.  ",1
2321,"Three million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on ReÌunion itself, but Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues pointed out that such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. ",0
2322,"Most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event, which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless.  ",1
2323,"In 1995, a morphological study by Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues suggested the closest extant relatives of the ReÌunion ibis are the African sacred ibis (T. aethiopicus) of Africa and the straw-necked ibis (T. spinicollis) of Australia.[22 ",0
2324,"Cheke and Hume instead suggested that it was closest to the Malagasy sacred ibis (T. bernieri), and therefore of ultimately African origin.  ",1
2325,"Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities.  ",1
2326,"Dubois' 1674 account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird,  here as translated by Strickland in 1848: Solitaires. ",1
2327,"They are the size of a large Goose, and are white, with the tips of the wings and tail black. ",0
2328,"The tail feathers resemble those of an Ostrich; the neck is long, and the beak is like that of a Woodcock, but larger; the legs and feet like those of Turkeys. ",0
2329,"This bird has recourse to running, as it flies but very little.  ",1
2330,"According to Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues, the plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African sacred ibis and straw-necked ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. ",0
2331,"In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an ostrich, which echoes Dubois' description. ",0
2332,"Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word (beÌcasse) from Dubois' original description, usually translated to ""woodcock"", could also mean oystercatcher, another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust,",0
2333,"Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the ReÌunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois' woodcock comparison.   bill. ",1
2334,"They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it.  ",1
2335,"The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to iridescence, as seen in the straw-necked ibis.  ",1
2336,"Subfossils of the ReÌunion ibis show that it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African sacred and straw-necked ibises. ",0
2337,"According to Hume, it would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length, the size of the African sacred ibis. ",0
2338,Rough protuberances on the wing bones of the ReÌunion ibis are similar to those of birds that use their wings in combat. ,0
2339,"It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant osteological traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known pectoral elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. ",0
2340,"The coracoid is elongated and the radius and ulna are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular foramen (or opening) between a metacarpal and the alular is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some ratites, penguins, and several extinct species.   ",1
2341,"As contemporary accounts are inconsistent on whether the ""solitaire"" was flightless or had some flight capability, Mourer-Chauvire and colleagues suggested that this was dependent on seasonal fat-cycles, meaning that individuals fattened themselves during cool seasons, but were slim during hot seasons; perhaps it could not fly when it was fat, but could when it was not.  ",1
2342,"However, Dubois specifically stated the ""solitaires"" did not have fat-cycles, unlike most other ReÌunion birds.  ",1
2343,"The only mention of its diet and exact habitat is the account of the French cartographer Jean Feuilley from 1708, which is also the last record of a living individual: The solitaires are the size of an average turkey cock, grey and white in colour. ",0
2344,"Their food is only worms and filth, taken on or in the soil.  ",1
2345,"The diet and mode of foraging described by Feuilley matches that of an ibis, whereas members of the Raphinae are known to have been fruit eaters.  ",1
2346,"The species was termed a land-bird by Dubois, so it did not live in typical ibis habitats such as wetlands. ",0
2347,"This is similar to the ReÌunion swamphen, which lived in forest rather than swamps, which is otherwise typical swamphen habitat. ",0
2348,"Cheke and Hume proposed that the ancestors of these birds colonised ReÌunion before swamps had developed, and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats. ",0
2349,"They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there, which may have occupied a similar niche.   ",1
2350,"The ReÌunion ibis appears to have lived in high altitudes, and perhaps had a limited distribution.  ",1
2351,"Accounts by early visitors indicate the species was found near their landing sites, but they were found only in remote places by 1667. ",0
2352,The bird may have survived in eastern lowlands until the 1670s. ,0
2353,"Though many late 17th century accounts state the bird was good food, Feuilley stated it tasted bad. ",0
2354,Many other endemic species of ReÌunion became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's ecosystem. ,0
2355,"This may be because it changed its diet when it moved to more rugged, higher terrain, to escape pigs that destroyed its nests; since it had limited flight capabilities, it probably nested on the ground.  ",1
2356,"The ReÌunion ibis lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the ReÌunion parakeet, the ReÌunion swamphen, the ReÌunion owl, the ReÌunion night heron, and the ReÌunion pink pigeon. ",0
2357,Extinct reptiles include the ReÌunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. ,0
2358,"The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on ReÌunion and Mauritius, but vanished from both islands.  ",1
2359,"As ReÌunion was populated by settlers, the ReÌunion ibis appears to have become confined to the tops of mountains. ",0
2360,Overhunting also contributed and several contemporary accounts state the bird was widely hunted for food.  ,1
2361,"In 1625, John Tatton described the tameness of the bird and how easy it was to hunt, as well as the large quantity consumed: There is store of land fowle both small and great, plenty of Doves, great Parrats, and such like; and a great fowle of the bignesse of a Turkie, very fat, and so short winged, that they cannot fly, being white, and in a manner tame: and so be all other fowles, as having not been troubled nor feared with shot. ",0
2362,Ten men may take fowle enough to serve fortie men a day.  ,1
2363,"In 1671, Melet mentioned the culinary quality of this species, and described the slaughter of several types of birds on the island: (A)nother sort of bird called solitaires which are very good (to eat) and the beauty of their plumage is most fascinating for the diversity of bright colours that shine on their wing and around their necks ",0
2364,There are birds in such great confusion and so tame that it is not necessary to go hunting with firearms ,0
2365,", they can so easily be killed with a little stick or rod. ",0
2366,"During the five or six days that we were allowed to go into the woods, so many were killed that our Generalde La Haye] was constrained to forbid anyone going beyond a hundred paces from the camp for fear the whole quarter would be destroyed, for one needed only to catch one bird alive and make it cry out, to have in a moment whole flocks coming to perch on people, so that often without moving from one spot one could kill hundreds. ",0
2367,"But, seeing that it would have been impossible to wipe out such a huge quantity, permission was again given to kill, which gave great joy to everyone, because very good fare was had at no expense.  ",1
2368,"The last definite account of the ""solitaire"" of ReÌunion was Feuilley's from 1708, indicating that the species probably became extinct sometime early in the century.  ",1
2369,"In the 1820s, the French navigator Louis de Freycinet asked an old slave about drontes (old Dutch word for dodo), and was told the bird existed around Saint-Joseph when his father was an infant. ",0
2370,"This would perhaps be a century earlier, but the account may be unreliable. ",0
2371,"Cheke and Hume suspect that feral cats initially hunted wildlife in the lowlands and later turned to higher inland areas, which were probably the last stronghold of the ReÌunion ibis, as they were unreachable by pigs. ",0
2372,"The species is thought to have been driven to extinction around 1710â1715.[5The ReÌunion swamphen (Porphyrio caerulescens), also known as the ReÌunion gallinule or oiseau bleu (French for ""blue bird""), is a hypothetical extinct species of rail that was endemic to the Mascarene island of ReÌunion. ",0
2373,"While only known from 17th and 18th century accounts by visitors to the island, it was scientifically named in 1848, based on the 1674 account by Sieur Dubois. ",0
2374,"A considerable literature was subsequently devoted to its possible affinities, with current researchers agreeing it was derived from the swamphen genus Porphyrio. ",0
2375,It has been considered mysterious and enigmatic due to the lack of any physical evidence of its existence. ,0
2376,This bird was described as entirely blue in plumage with a red beak and legs. ,0
2377,"It was said to be the size of a ReÌunion ibis or chicken, which could mean 65â70 cm (26â28 in) in length, and it may have been similar to the takahe. ",0
2378,"While easily hunted, it was a fast runner and able to fly, though it did so reluctantly. ",0
2379,"It may have fed on plant matter and invertebrates, as do other swamphens, and was said to nest among grasses and aquatic ferns. ",0
2380,"It was only found on the Plaine des Cafres plateau, to which it may have retreated during the latter part of its existence, whereas other swamphens inhabit lowland swamps. ",0
2381,"While the last unequivocal account is from 1730, it may have survived until 1763, but overhunting and the introduction of cats probably drove it to extinction. ",0
2382,Visitors to the Mascarene island of ReÌunion during the 17th and 18th centuries reported blue birds (oiseaux bleus in French). ,0
2383,"The first such account is that of the French traveller Sieur Dubois, who was on ReÌunion from 1669 to 1672, which was published in 1674.    ",1
2384,The British naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland stated in 1848 that he would have thought Dubois' account referred to a member of the swamphen genus Porphyrio if not for its large size and other features (and noted the term oiseau bleu had also been erroneously used for bats on ReÌunion in an old account). ,0
2385,"Strickland expressed hope that remains of this and other extinct Mascarene birds would be found there.  Responding to Strickland's book later that year, the Belgian scientist Edmond de SeÌlys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis coerulescens based on Dubois' account. ",1
2386,"Selys Longchamps also included two other Mascarene birds, at the time only known from contemporary accounts, in the genus Apterornis: the ReÌunion ibis (now Threskiornis solitarius); and the red rail (now Aphanapteryx bonasia). ",0
2387,"He thought them related to the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, due to their shared rudimentary wings, tail, and the disposition of their digits.    ",1
2388,"The name Apterornis had already been used for a different extinct bird genus from New Zealand (originally spelled Aptornis, the adzebills) by the British biologist Richard Owen earlier in 1848, and the French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte coined the new binomial Cyanornis erythrorhynchus for the oiseau bleu in 1857. ",0
2389,"The same year, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel moved the species to the genus Porphyrio, as P. (Notornis) caerulescens, indicating an affinity with the takahe (now called Porphyrio hochstetteri, then also referred to as Notornis by some authors) of New Zealand. ",0
2390,"Schlegel argued that the discovery of the takahe showed that members of Porphyrio could be large, thereby disproving Strickland's earlier doubts based on size.    ",1
2391,The British ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe simply used the name Porphyrio caerulescens in 1894.  ,1
2392,"The British zoologist Walter Rothschild retained the name Apterornis for the bird in 1907, and considered it similar to Aptornis and the takahe, believing Dubois' account indicated it was related to those birds.  ",1
2393,"The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka used the new combination Cyanornis coerulescens for the bird in 1953 (with the specific name misspelled), also considering it related to the takahe due to its size.   ",1
2394,"Throughout the 20th century the bird was usually considered a member of Porphyrio or Notornis, and the latter genus was eventually itself considered a junior synonym of Porphyrio.   ",1
2395,"Some writers equated the bird with extant swamphens, including African swamphens by the French ornithologist Jacques Berlioz in 1946, and western swamphens by the French ornithologist Nicolas BarreÌ in 1996, despite their different habitat. ",0
2396,"The French ornithologist Philippe Milon doubted the Porphyrio affiliation in 1951, since Dubois' account stated the ReÌunion bird tasted good, while extant swamphens do not.   ",1
2397,"In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that the bird ""must remain mysterious"" until Porphyrio bones are one day uncovered.  ",1
2398,"In 1974, an attempt was made to find fossil localities on the Plaine des Cafres plateau, where the bird was said to have lived, but no caves (which might contain kitchen middens where early settlers discarded bones of local birds) were found, and it was determined that a more careful study of the area was needed before excavations could be made.  ",1
2399,"In 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson found the old accounts consistent with an endemic derivative of Porphyrio, and considered it a probable species whose remains might one day be discovered.  ",1
2400,"The British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke considered previous arguments about the bird's affinities in 1987, and supported it being a Porphyrio relative, while noting that there were two further contemporary accounts.  ",1
2401,"The same year, the British writer Errol Fuller listed the bird as a hypothetical species, and expressed puzzlement as to how a considerable literature had been derived from such ""flimsy material"".  ",1
2402,They stated the reason no fossils of it had been found was probably because it did not live in the parts of ReÌunion where fossils might have been preserved. ,1
2403,"Cheke and the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume stated in 2008 that since the mystery of the ""ReÌunion solitaire"" had been solved after it was identified with ibis remains, the ReÌunion swamphen remains the most enigmatic of the Mascarene birds from the old accounts.  ",1
2404,"In his 2012 book about extinct birds and his 2019 monograph about extinct Mascarene rails, Hume stated that the ReÌunion swamphen had been mentioned by trustworthy observers, but was ""perhaps the most enigmatic of all rails"" with no evidence to resolve its taxonomy. ",0
2405,"He thought there was no doubt that it was a derivative of Porphyrio, as the all blue colouration is only found in that genus among rails. ",0
2406,"While it may have been derived from Africa or Madagascar, genetic studies have shown that other rails have dispersed unexpectedly far in distance from their closest relatives, making alternate explanations possible.   ",1
2407,"The ReÌunion swamphen was described as having entirely blue plumage with a red beak and legs, and is generally agreed to have been a large, terrestrial swamphen, with features indicative of reduced flight capability, such as larger size and more robust legs. ",0
2408,"There has been disagreement over the size of the bird, as Dubois' account compared its size with that of a ReÌunion ibis while that of the French engineer Jean Feuilley from 1704 compared it to a domestic chicken. ",0
2409,"Cheke stated in 1987 that Feuilley's account would indicate the bird was not unusually large, perhaps the size of a swamphen. ",0
2410,"Hume pointed out in 2019 that the ReÌunion ibis would have been 65â68 cm (26â27 in) at most, similar to the extant African sacred ibis (including the tail), while chickens could be 65â70 cm (26â28 in) in length (the size of their ancestor, the wild red junglefowl), and there was therefore no contradiction. ",0
2411,The ReÌunion swamphen would thereby have been about the same size as the takahe.    ,1
2412,"The first description of the ReÌunion swamphen is that of Dubois from 1674: As big as the solitairesReÌunion ibis]; their plumage is entirely blue, the beak and the feet red and made like those of hens; they do not fly, but run extremely quickly, so that a dog has difficulty catching them in a chase; they are very goodto eat].  ",1
2413,The last definite account of the bird is that of the priest Father Brown from around 1730 (expanded from a 1717 account by Le Gentil):   Towards the east of the island there is a little plateau up a high mountain called the Plaine des Cafres where one finds a large blue bird whose colour is very striking. ,1
2414,"It flies but rarely and always barely above the ground, but it walks with surprising speed. ",0
2415,The inhabitants have never called it anything other than oiseau bleu; its flesh is quite good and keeps well.  ,1
2416,"Olson stated the comparison to a ""wood pigeon"" was a reference to the common wood pigeon, implying that Brown described it as smaller than Dubois did, while Hume suggested it could be the extinct ReÌunion blue pigeon.   ",1
2417,"The 1708 account of HeÌbert does not add much information, though he qualified its colouration as ""dark blue"".  ",1
2418,"While the bird is only known from written accounts, reconstructions of it appear in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds, and Hachisuka's 1953 book The Dodo and Kindred Birds.  ",1
2419,"Rothschild stated he had the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans depict it as intermediate between the takahe and Aptornis, which he thought its closest relatives.  ",1
2420,"Fuller found Frohawk's illustration to be a well-produced work, though almost entirely conjectural in depicting it like a slimmed-down takahe.  ",1
2421,"Little is known about the ecology of the ReÌunion swamphen; it was easily caught and killed, unlike other swamphens (which avoid predators by flying or hiding), though it was able to run fast.   ",1
2422,"While some early researchers thought the bird to be flightless, Brown's account states it could fly, and it is thought to have been a reluctant flier.   ",1
2423,"Hume suggested it may have fed on plant matter and invertebrates, as other swamphens do. ",0
2424,"At least in the latter part of its existence, it appears to have been confined to mountains (retreating there between the 1670s and 1705), in particular to the Plaine des Cafres plateau, situated at an altitude of about 1,600â1,800 m (5,200â5,900 ft) in south-central ReÌunion. ",0
2425,"The environment of this area consists of open woodland in a subalpine forest steppe, and has marshy pools.  ",1
2426,"The ReÌunion swamphen was termed a land-bird by Dubois, while other swamphens inhabit lowland swamps. ",0
2427,"This is similar to the ReÌunion ibis, which lived in forest rather than wetlands, which is otherwise typical ibis habitat. ",0
2428,"Cheke and Hume proposed that the ancestors of these birds colonised ReÌunion before swamps had developed, and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats. ",0
2429,"They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there, which may have occupied a similar ecological niche.   Feuilley described some characteristics of the bird in 1704: ",1
2430,"The Oiseaux bleuff live in the plaines on top of the mountains, and especially on the Plaine des Cafres. ",0
2431,"They are the size of a large capon, blue in colour. ",0
2432,"Those that are old are worth nothing to eat because they are so tough, but when they are young they are excellent. ",0
2433,Hunting them is not difficult because one kills them with sticks or with stones.  ,1
2434,The only account of its nesting behaviour is that of La Roque from 1708: One sees therethe Plaines de Cafres] a great number of oiseaux bleus which nest among grasses and aquatic ferns.  ,1
2435,Many other endemic species on ReÌunion became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's ecosystem. ,0
2436,"The ReÌunion swamphen lived alongside other now-extinct birds, such as the ReÌunion ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the Hoopoe starling, the ReÌunion parakeet, the ReÌunion owl, the ReÌunion night heron, and the ReÌunion pink pigeon. ",0
2437,Extinct ReÌunion reptiles include the ReÌunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. ,0
2438,Tropidophora carinata lived on ReÌunion and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.  ,1
2439,"Many terrestrial rails are flightless, and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man-made changes; as a result, rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds. ",0
2440,"All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, all caused by human activities.  ",1
2441,"Overhunting was the main cause of the ReÌunion swamphen's extinction (it was considered good game and was easy to catch), but according to Cheke and Hume, the introduction of cats at the end of the 17th century could have contributed to the elimination of the bird once these became feral and reached its habitat. ",0
2442,"Today, cats are still a serious threat to native birds, in particular Barau's petrel, since they occur all over ReÌunion, including the most remote and high peaks.   ",1
2443,The eggs and chicks would also have been vulnerable to rats after their accidental introduction in 1676.  ,1
2444,"On the other hand, the ReÌunion swamphen and other birds of the island appear to have successfully survived feral pigs.  ",1
2445,"Cattle grazing on Plaine des Cafres was promoted by the French explorer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier in the 1750s, which may have also had an impact on the bird.  ",1
2446,"While the last unequivocal account of the ReÌunion swamphen is from 1730, an anonymous account from 1763, possibly by the British Brigadier-General Richard Smith, may be the last mention of this bird, though no description of it was provided, and it might refer to another species.  ",1
2447,It is also impossible to say whether this writer saw the bird himself.  ,1
2448,"It gives a contemporary impression of the ReÌunion swamphen's habitat, Plaine des Cafres, and of how birds were hunted there: The plain des Caffres, is formed by the summits of mountains at a very considerable elevation above the sea: it is said to be twenty miles in extent, and is very flat, and without stones. ",0
2449,"The access to it is very difficult in certain places, though it may be ascended on horseback. ",0
2450,"The air is very pure, but as cold as winterâs day in England. ",0
2451,"When the clouds pass over the surface of the plain, they have all the effect of a gentle rain. ",0
2452,"A brook runs through the middle of it, which is broad but shallow, has a sandy bottom, and freezes in the winter . ",0
2453,"There are also some curious birds, which never descend to the sea-side, and who are so little accustomed to, or alarmed at, the sight of man, that they suffer themselves to be killed by the stroke of a walking stick.  ",1
2454,"If the ReÌunion swamphen survived until 1763 this would be far longer than many other extinct birds of ReÌunion, probably due to its remote habitat.   ",1
2455,The rock martin (Ptyonoprogne fuligula) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family that is resident in central and southern Africa. ,0
2456,"It breeds mainly in the mountains, but also at lower altitudes, especially in rocky areas and around towns, and, unlike most swallows, it is often found far from water. ",0
2457,"It is 12â15 cm (4.7â5.9 in) long, with mainly brown plumage, paler-toned on the upper breast and underwing coverts, and with white ""windows"" on the spread tail in flight. ",0
2458,"The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and flight feathers. ",0
2459,"The former northern subspecies are smaller, paler, and whiter-throated than southern African forms, and are now usually split as a separate species, the pale crag martin. ",0
2460,The rock martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding. ,0
2461,"This martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. ",0
2462,"The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings, dam walls, culverts and bridges. ",0
2463,It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. ,0
2464,"This species is a solitary breeder, and is not gregarious, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. ",0
2465,"The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16â19 days prior to hatching. ",0
2466,"Fledging takes another 22â24 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight. ",0
2467,"This small martin is caught in flight by several fast, agile falcon species, such as hobbies, and it sometimes carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. ",0
2468,"Because of its range of nearly 10 million km2 (4 million sq mi) and large, apparently stable, population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. ",0
2469,"The rock martin was formally described in 1842 as Hirundo fuligula by German physician, explorer and zoologist Martin Lichtenstein  and was moved to the new genus Ptyonoprogne by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850.  ",1
2470,"Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus, the pale crag martin, P. obsoleta of north Africa, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris.  ",1
2471,"The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ptuon (ÏÏÏÌÎ¿Î1⁄2), ""a fan"", referring to the shape of the opened tail, and Procne (Î ÏÎ¿ÌÎoÎ1⁄2Î·), a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow.  The specific name fuligula means ""sooty-throated"", from Latin fuligo ""soot"" and gula ""throat"".  ",1
2472,"The three Ptyonoprogne species are members of the swallow family, and are placed in the subfamily Hirundininae, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. ",0
2473,"DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built.  ",1
2474,"The groups are the ""core martins"" including burrowing species like the sand martin, the ""nest-adopters"", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the ""mud nest builders"". ",0
2475,The Ptyonoprogne species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to the last group. ,0
2476,"Hirundo species also build open nests, Delichon house martins have a closed nest, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel.  ",1
2477,"The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus, Hirundo, but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo should contain all the mud-builder genera. ",0
2478,"Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research suggested that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.  ",1
2479,"There are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size, although the differences are clinal, and races interbreed where their ranges meet. ",0
2480,"The small, pale former subspecies (obsoleta, peroplasta, perpallida, presaharica, spatzi, arabica and buchanani) found in the mountains of North Africa, the Arabian peninsula and southwest Asia are now normally split as a separate species, the pale crag martin,  following German ornithologist Jean Cabanis, who first formally described these birds,  but the changes in size and colour are continuous, and the forms often intergrade where they meet, so the evidence for separate species is not strong.  ",1
2481,The southern forms of the rock martin can weigh more than twice as much as the smallest northern subspecies of pale crag martin. ,0
2482,The average weight for P. f. fusciventris is 22.4 g (0.79 oz) against 10 g (0.35 oz) for P. o. obsoleta.  ,1
2483,"The robust, large-billed southernmost forms (P. f. fuligula, P. f. pretoriae, and P. f. anderssoni) are sufficiently different from dark, fine-billed P. f. fusciventris that the latter could also be regarded as a potentially different species.  ",1
2484,"However, Rhodesian ornithologist Michael Irwin collected specimens from southern Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) which were dark above like P. f. fusciventris and rich reddish below like P. f. fuligula. ",0
2485,"This led him to suggest that the two groups had previously been isolated, but were probably hybridising following secondary contact.  ",1
2486,The rock martin of the nominate subspecies P. f. fuligula is 12â15 cm (4.7â5.9 in)  long with earth-brown upperparts and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. ,1
2487,"It has a cinnamon chin, throat, upper breast and underwing coverts, with the rest of the underparts being a similar brown to the upperparts. ",0
2488,"The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. ",0
2489,"The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. ",0
2490,The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed above.  ,1
2491,"The rock martin's flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides, and it is more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. ",0
2492,"It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling the call of the common house martin, a nasal vick,  and a high pitched twee contact call.  ",1
2493,"The rock martin is much drabber than most African swallows, and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of the genus Riparia.  ",1
2494,"The pale crag martin is smaller, paler and greyer than its southern relative.  ",1
2495,"Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the rock martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band.  ",1
2496,"It is paler on the throat, breast and underwings than the all-dark form of the brown-throated sand martin.  ",1
2497,"The rock martin breeds in suitable habitat in Africa north to Nigeria, Chad and Ethiopia. ",0
2498,It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. ,0
2499,"This species has been recorded as a vagrant in Gabon, and its status in Congo is uncertain.    ",1
2500,"The natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs, gorges and caves up to 3,700 m (12,000 ft) above sea level,  but this martin also breeds in lowlands, especially if rocks or buildings are available, and may be found far from water. ",1
2501,"It readily uses man-made structures as a substitute for natural precipices.  Rock martin pairs often nest alone, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form with up to 40 pairs. ",1
2502,These martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. ,0
2503,"Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season. ",0
2504,"The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. ",0
2505,"It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or bowl-shaped like that of the barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. ",0
2506,"The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years.   ",1
2507,The clutch is usually two or three buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown particularly at the wide end. ,0
2508,The average egg size in South Africa was 20.8 x 14.1 mm (0.82 x 0.56 in) with a weight of 2.17 g (0.077 oz). ,0
2509,Both adults incubate the eggs for 16â19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly. ,0
2510,"The fledging time can vary from 22â24 days to 25â30 days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food.  ",1
2511,"The rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, although it will occasionally feed on the ground. ",0
2512,"When breeding, birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory. ",0
2513,"The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes and other flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. ",0
2514,"This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant.  ",1
2515,Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. ,0
2516,"Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.  ",1
2517,"A study of nine bird species including four hirundines showed that the more young there are in a nest, the more frequent are the parents' feeding visits, but the visits do not increase in proportion to the number of young. ",0
2518,On average a solitary nestling therefore gets more food than a member of a pair or of a trio. ,0
2519,"Since the nestling period is not prolonged in proportion to the drop in feeding rate, an individual fledgling from a larger brood is likely to weigh less when it leaves the nest. ",0
2520,"However, a subspecies of the rock martin (P. f. fusciventris) was an anomaly in respect of both feeding rate and nestling time. ",0
2521,"There was no difference in parental feeding rate for members of a pair and members of a trio, but the nestling period averaged 1.5 days longer for trios than pairs.  ",1
2522,"Some falcons have the speed and agility to catch swallows and martins in flight, and rock martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon,  ",1
2523,"Rock martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts,  which sometimes forcibly take over the martin's nests.  ",1
2524,"In 1975, one of the first findings of the tick Argas (A.) africolumbae was in a nest of Ptyonoprogne f. fusciventris in Kenya,  at that time the martin was described under its synonym Ptyonoprogne fuligula rufigula (Fischer & Reichenow).  ",1
2525,The rock martin has a very large range of 9.5 million km2 (3.7 million sq mi). ,0
2526,"The total population is unknown, but the bird is described as generally common, although scarce in Botswana and Namibia. ",0
2527,"The population is thought to be stable, mainly due to the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats. ",0
2528,"Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the rock martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  ",1
2529,The rock parrot (Neophema petrophila) is a species of grass parrot native to Australia. ,0
2530,"Described by John Gould in 1841, it is a small parrot 22 to 24 cm (8 3â4 to 9 1â2 in) long and weighing 50â60 g (1 3â4â2 oz) with predominantly olive-brown upperparts and more yellowish underparts. ",0
2531,"Its head is olive with light blue forecheeks and lores, and a dark blue frontal band line across the crown with lighter blue above and below. ",0
2532,"The sexes are similar in appearance, although the female tends to have a duller frontal band and less blue on the face. ",0
2533,"Rocky islands and coastal dune areas are the preferred habitats for this species, which is found from Lake Alexandrina in southeastern South Australia westwards across coastal South and Western Australia to Shark Bay. ",0
2534,"Unlike other grass parrots, it nests in burrows or rocky crevices mostly on offshore islands such as Rottnest Island. ",0
2535,Seeds of grasses and succulent plants form the bulk of its diet. ,0
2536,"The species has suffered in the face of feral mammals; although its population is declining, it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ",0
2537,"The rock parrot was described by the English ornithologist John Gould in 1841 as Euphema petrophila,  its specific name petrophila derived from the Greek petros/ÏÎμÏÏÎ¿Ï 'rock' and philos/ÏÎ1Î»Î¿Ï 'loving'.  ",1
2538,The author's specimen was one of fifty new bird species presented before the Zoological Society of London.  ,1
2539,"The rock parrot was included in Gould's fifth volume of Birds of Australia, using specimens obtained at Port Lincoln in South Australia and from collector John Gilbert in Western Australia. ",0
2540,"Gilbert stated that at the time of English colonisation the species was common on cliff faces on offshore islands, including Rottnest, near the western port of Fremantle, the nests in almost inaccessible locations.  ",1
2541,"The Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori defined the new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the rock parrot within it and giving it its current scientific name Neophema petrophila.  Within the grass parrot genus Neophema, it is one of four species classified in the subgenus Neonanodes and is most closely related to the orange-bellied parrot (N. chrysogaster), the other two species being the blue-winged (N. chrysostoma)  and elegant parrot (N. elegans).  ",1
2542,"A burrow-nester, the rock parrot has evolved from a lineage of tree-nesting ancestors. ",0
2543,The biologist Donald Brightsmith has proposed that several lineages of parrots and trogons switched to nesting in burrows to avoid tree-living mammalian predators that evolved and proliferated in the late Oligocene to early Miocene (30â20 million years ago).  ,1
2544,"Two subspecies are recognised by the International Ornithologists' Union: subspecies petrophila from Western Australia and subspecies zietzi from South Australia,  the latter described by Gregory Mathews in 1912 from the Sir Joseph Banks Group in Spencer Gulf,  after the Assistant Director of the South Australian Museum Amandus Heinrich Christian Zietz.  ",1
2545,The authors of the online edition of the Handbook of the Birds of the World do not regard this as distinct.  ,1
2546,"""Rock parrot""  has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ",1
2547,"Gilbert reported the Swan River colonists called it the rock parrakeet, and he labelled it the rock grass-parrakeet. It is also known as rock elegant parrot.  ",1
2548,"The sexes are similar in appearance, with predominantly olive-brown upperparts including the head and neck, and more yellowish underparts. ",0
2549,"A dark blue band runs across the upper forehead between the eyes, bordered above by a thin light blue line that extends behind the eyes and below by a thicker light blue band across the lower forehead. ",0
2550,"In the adult female, the dark blue band is slightly duller and there is less blue on the face. ",0
2551,"The wings are predominantly olive, and display a two-toned blue leading edge when folded. ",0
2552,"The primary flight feathers are black with dark blue edges, while the inner wing feathers are olive. ",0
2553,The tail is turquoise edged with yellow on its upper surface. ,0
2554,"The breast, flanks and abdomen are more olive-yellow, becoming more yellow towards the vent.  ",1
2555,"The bases of the feathers on the head and body are grey, apart from those on the nape, which are white. ",0
2556,"The bill is black with pale highlights on both mandibles, the cere is black. ",0
2557,The orbital eye-ring is grey and the iris is dark brown. ,0
2558,"The legs and feet are dark grey, with a pink tinge on the soles and rear of the tarsi.  ",1
2559,"Subspecies zietzi has paler and more yellowish plumage overall, though is of a similar size. ",0
2560,"Juveniles are a duller, darker olive all over and either lack or have indistinct blue frontal bands. ",0
2561,"Its plumage darkens with wear, and may be indistinguishable from the nominate subspecies when old.  ",1
2562,"They have a yellowish or orange bill initially, which turns brown by ten weeks of age.  ",1
2563,Juvenile females have pale oval spots on their fourth to eighth primary flight feathers.  ,1
2564,They moult from juvenile to immature plumage when a few months old.  ,1
2565,They then moult into adult plumage when they are twelve months old.  ,1
2566,"The rock parrot can be confused with the elegant parrot in Western Australia, or blue-winged parrot in South Australia, both of which have similar (though brighter) olive plumage. ",0
2567,These two species also have yellow lores and the latter has much bluer wings. ,0
2568,The rock parrot occurs along the coastline of southern Australia in two disjunct populations. ,0
2569,"In South Australia, it is found as far east as Lake Alexandrina and Goolwa, though is rare in the Fleurieu Peninsula. ",0
2570,"It was reported further east at Baudin Rocks near Robe, South Australia, in the 1930s, though not since. ",0
2571,"It is more common  along the coastline of the northeastern Gulf St Vincent between Lefevre Peninsula and Port Wakefield, and Yorke Peninsula across Investigator Strait to Kangaroo Island, the Gambier Islands, and the Eyre Peninsula from Arno Bay to Ceduna and nearby Nuyts Archipelago. ",0
2572,"In Western Australia it is found from the Eyre Bird Observatory in the east, along the southern and western coastline to Jurien Bay Marine Park, becoming less common further north to Kalbarri and Shark Bay. ",0
2573,"The rock parrot is generally sedentary, though birds may disperse over 160 km (100 mi) after breeding. ",0
2574,Some do remain on the offshore islands where they breed year-round.  ,1
2575,"The rock parrot is almost always encountered within a few hundred metres of the coast down to the high-water mark, though may occasionally follow estuaries a few kilometres inland. ",0
2576,"The preferred habitat is bare rocky ground or low coastal shrubland composed of plants such as pigface (Disphyma crassifolium clavellatum), saltbush (Atriplex) or nitre bush (Nitraria billardierei). ",0
2577,"The species has also been found in sand dunes and saltmarsh, and under sprinklers on the golf course on Rottnest Island. ",0
2578,"Rock parrots are encountered in pairs or small groups, although they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 100 birds. ",0
2579,"Mostly terrestrial, rock parrots at times perch on rocks or shrubs, and can take cover among large rocks. ",0
2580,"Generally quiet and unobtrusive, they make a two-syllabled zitting contact call in flight or when feeding, while the alarm call is similar but louder.  ",1
2581,"It mostly breeds on offshore islands, including the Sir Joseph Banks Group and Nuyts Archipelago in South Australia, and Recherche Archipelago, Eclipse Island, Rottnest Island and islands in Jurien Bay. ",0
2582,"On the mainland, nesting has been reported at Point Malcolm near Israelite Bay and Margaret River in Western Australia.  ",1
2583,"Rock parrots are monogamous, the breeding pairs maintaining fidelity throughout their lives, although an individual may seek a new mate if the previous one dies.  ",1
2584,"At the beginning of the breeding season, rock parrots become more active, the males calling more often. ",0
2585,"The male courts the female by moving towards her in an upright posture, bobbing his head and calling. ",0
2586,"The female responds by performing a begging call for him to feed her, which he does with some regurgitated food. ",0
2587,This has been observed to continue through the incubation period in captivity.  ,1
2588,"The nesting site is under rocks or in crevices or burrows, which may be covered by plants such as pigface,  or heart-shaped noon flower (Aptenia cordifolia). ",1
2589,They may re-use burrows of wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) or white-faced storm petrels (Pelagodroma marina). ,0
2590,"Regardless of location, nests are well-hidden and hard to access; the depth of the nest has been measured as 10â91 cm (4â36 in) in crevices, approximately 15 cm (6 in) under ledges, and 91â122 cm (36â48 in) for reused seabird burrows.[19 ",0
2591," Rock parrots can nest in considerable numbers at some locations, with nests metres apart.  ",1
2592,"The clutch consists of three to six round or oval dull to glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 24 to 25 mm (1.0 in) long by 19 to 20 mm (0.8 in) wide.  ",1
2593,"Eggs are laid at an interval of two to four days, and a second brood may take place in favourable years. ",0
2594,Gilbert's local indigenous guides reported that nests were found to contain seven to eight white eggs.  ,1
2595,"The female alone incubates the clutch, over a period of 18 to 21 days, and is fed by the male during this time.  ",1
2596,"The chicks are born helpless and blind,  their salmon-pink skin covered in pale grey ",1
2597,"By day eight they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day nine and their down is dark grey. ",0
2598,They have well-developed wing and tail feathers by day 21 and are almost fully covered in feathers by day 28. ,0
2599,They fledge (leave the nest) at around 30 days of age in the wild and up to 39 days of age in captivity. ,0
2600,"Foraging takes place in the early morning and late afternoon, with a rest during the heat of the day. ",0
2601,"Birds forage in pairs or small groups, though up to 200 individuals may gather at an abundant food or water source.  ",1
2602,"They generally forage on the ground, and can be approached easily while feeding, moving a short distance behind a tussock or rock if observers come too close.  ",1
2603,"Rock parrots eat seeds of several species of grass (Poaceae), including common wild oat (Avena fatua), wheat (Triticum aestivum), hare's tail (Lagurus ovatus), and Australian brome (Bromus arenarius),  and rush (Cyperaceae), as well as shrubs and particularly succulent plants of the family Aizoaceae, such as pigface, and Carpobrotus rossii, and the introduced species Carpobrotus aequilaterus and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. ",0
2604,"Daisy species' seed consumed include coastal daisybush (Olearia axillaris), variable groundsel (Senecio pinnatifolius), and the introduced capeweed (Arctotheca calendula), South African beach daisy (Arctotheca populifolia) and prickly sow-thistle (Sonchus asper). ",0
2605,Brassicaceae include the native leafy peppercress (Lepidium foliosum) and introduced European searocket (Cakile maritima). ,0
2606,"Chenopod species include Atriplex, shrubby glasswort (Tecticornia arbuscula), ruby saltbush (Enchylaena tomentosa), berry saltbush (Chenopodium baccatum), and other species such as pink purslane (Calandrinia calyptrata), species of Acacia, Acaena and Myoporum, the coastal beard-heath (Leucopogon parviflorus), common sea heath (Frankenia pauciflora), and coastal jugflower (Adenanthos cuneatus).  ",1
2607,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the rock parrot as a species of least concern, though the overall population is decreasing. ",0
2608,It is threatened by feral animals (mainly cats and foxes) and climate change.  ,1
2609,"Feral cats were cited after the species vanished from the vicinity of Albany, Western Australia, in 1905, but the species was found again in 1939.  ",1
2610,"On Rottnest Island, the species was common up to at least 1929. ",0
2611,"On a survey of the island in 1965, Western Australian biologist Glen Storr found it to have become rare and concluded this was due to young birds being taken for the pet trade.  ",1
2612,This occurred mainly in the 1940s and 1950s before being closed down in the 1970s.  ,1
2613,"The population did not recover,  and by 2012 had dropped to seven birds. ",1
2614,The use of artificial nesting sites and a breeding program has seen some success and a rise in numbers.  Birds on the island are being banded and the public urged to get involved.  ,1
2615,"Like most species of parrot, the rock parrot is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.  ",1
2616,The species is infrequently kept in captivity and there are few records of successful breeding. ,0
2617,The plumage of this Neophema species is duller than others and they have a reputation as passive and uninteresting caged specimens. ,0
2618,"Differentiating the sexes presents difficulties to parrot enthusiasts, with no reliable means available to simple examination in the hand. ",0
2619,"The rock parrot, also known as the rock grass-parakeet in the bird trade, may be a more desirable specimen when kept as part of a colony, provided with logs simulating tree hollows and fed on Mesembryanthemum and Carpobrotus species.  ",1
2620,"The parrot may become obese, unwell or infertile by overindulgence in sunflower seed, and aviculturists recommend reducing the availability of these in the aviary. ",1
2621,"The Rodrigues parrot or Leguat's parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar. ",0
2622,"It is unclear to which other species it is most closely related, but it is classified as a member of the tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. ",0
2623,"The Rodrigues parrot bore similarities to the broad-billed parrot of Mauritius, and may have been related. ",0
2624,"Two additional species have been assigned to its genus (N. francicus and N. borbonicus), based on descriptions of parrots from the other Mascarene islands, but their identities and validity have been debated. ",0
2625,"The Rodrigues parrot was green, and had a proportionally large head and beak and a long tail. ",0
2626,"Its exact size is unknown, but it may have been around 50 cm (20 in) long. ",0
2627,"It was the largest parrot on Rodrigues, and it had the largest head of any Mascarene parrot. ",0
2628,"By the time it was discovered, it frequented and nested on islets off southern Rodrigues, where introduced rats were absent, and fed on the seeds of the shrub Fernelia buxifolia. ",0
2629,The species is known from subfossil bones and from mentions in contemporary accounts. ,0
2630,"It was last mentioned in 1761, and probably became extinct soon after, perhaps due to a combination of predation by rats, deforestation, and hunting by humans. ",0
2631,"Birds thought to be the Rodrigues parrot were first mentioned by FrancÌ§ois Leguat in his 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies. ",0
2632,Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there. ,0
2633,"Subsequent accounts were written by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his Relation de l'IÌle Rodrigue, and then by the French mathematician Alexandre PingreÌ, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus.    ",1
2634,"The Rodrigues parrot was scientifically described and named as Psittacus rodricanus in 1867 by the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards, based on a subfossil partial beak.  ",1
2635,"The specific name refers to Rodrigues, which is itself named after the discoverer of the island, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Rodrigues.  ",1
2636,"Milne-Edwards corrected the spelling of the specific name to rodericanus in 1873 (in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds), a spelling which was used in the literature henceforward, but it was changed back to rodricanus by the IOC World Bird List in 2014.   Milne-Edwards moved the species to its own genus Necropsittacus in 1874; the name is derived from the Greek words nekros, which means dead, and psittakos, parrot, in reference to the bird being extinct.   ",1
2637,"It may be specimen UMZC 575, a rostrum that was sent from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist Alfred Newton after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne-Edwards's paper, but this cannot be confirmed.  ",1
2638,"In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones.[10 ",0
2639,"] Remains of the species are scarce, but subfossils have been discovered in caves on the Plaine Corail and in Caverne Tortue.  ",1
2640,"In the footnotes to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil species with parrots mentioned by Leguat.  ",1
2641,"In 1875, A. Newton analysed Julien Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified a description of the Rodrigues parrot.  ",1
2642,"In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul).  ",1
2643,"As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.  ",1
2644,"Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), are derived from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well. ",0
2645,"Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands.  ",1
2646,"Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones.  ",1
2647,"Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter.  ",1
2648,The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.  ,1
2649,"Hume has suggested that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean.  ",1
2650,"The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.  ",1
2651,The British zoologist Walther Rothschild assigned two hypothetical parrot species from the other Mascarene Islands to the genus Necropsittacus; N. francicus in 1905 and N. borbonicus in 1907. ,0
2652,"Rothschild gave the original description of N. francicus as ""head and tail fiery red, rest of body and tail green"", and stated it was based on descriptions from voyages to Mauritius in the 17th and early 18th century. ",0
2653,"N. borbonicus (named for Bourbon, the original name of ReÌunion) was based on a single account by the French traveller Sieur Dubois, who mentioned ""green parrots of the same sizepresumably as the ReÌunion parakeet (Psittacula eques eques)] with head, upper parts of the wings, and tail the colour of fire"" on ReÌunion. ",0
2654,"Rothschild considered it to belong to Necropsittacus since Dubois compared it with Psittacula species, which are related.     ",1
2655,"The two assigned Necropsittacus species have since become the source of much taxonomic confusion, and their identities have been debated. ",0
2656,"N. borbonicus later received common names such as ReÌunion red and green parakeet or ReÌunion parrot, and N. francicus has been called the Mauritian parrot. ",0
2657,"The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka recognised N. borbonicus in 1953, and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by Dubois and the body-plan of the Rodrigues parrot. ",0
2658,"He did not find the naming of N. francicus to have been necessary, but expressed hope more evidence would be found. ",0
2659,"In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that N. borbonicus may have been an escaped pet lory seen by Dubois, since 16th century Dutch paintings show the somewhat similar East Indian chattering lory (Lorius garrulus), presumably in captivity. ",0
2660,"However, Greenway was unable to find any references that matched those Rothschild had given for N. francicus.    ",1
2661,"In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke found the described colour-pattern of N. borbonicus remiscent of Psittacula parrots, but considered N. francicus to be based on confused reports.  ",1
2662,"In 2001 the British writer Errol Fuller suggested Dubois's account of N. borbonicus could either have referred to an otherwise unrecorded species or have been misleading, and found N. francicus to be ""one of the most dubious of all hypothetical species"".  ",1
2663,"In 2007, Hume suggested that Rothschild had associated N. borbonicus with the Rodrigues parrot because he had mistakenly incorporated Dubois's account into his description of the latter; he stated the Rodrigues parrot also had red plumage (though it was all-green), and had been mentioned by Dubois (who never visited Rodrigues). ",0
2664,"Rothschild also attributed the sighting of N. francicus to Dubois, repeating the colour-pattern he had described earlier for the Rodrigues parrot, and this led Hume to conclude that the name N. francicus was based solely on ""the muddled imagination of Lord Rothschild"". ",0
2665,"Hume added that if Dubois's description of N. borbonicus was based on a parrot endemic to ReÌunion, it may have been derived from the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria), which has a similar colouration, apart from the red tail.   ",1
2666,"The Rodrigues parrot was described as being the largest parrot species on the island, with a big head and a long tail. ",0
2667,"Its skull was flat and depressed compared to those of most other parrots, but similar to the genus Ara. ",0
2668,"The skull was 50 mm (2.0 in) long without the beak, 38 mm (1.5 in) wide, and 24 mm (0.94 in) deep. ",0
2669,"The coracoid (part of the shoulder) was 35 mm (1.4 in) long, the humerus (upper-arm bone) 53 mm (2.1 in), the ulna (lower-arm bone) 57 mm (2.2 in), the femur (thigh-bone) 49 mm (1.9 in), the tibia (lower-leg bone) 63 mm (2.5 in), and the metatarsus (foot bone) 22 mm (0.87 in).  ",1
2670,"Its exact body length is unknown, but it may have been around 50 cm (20 in), comparable to the size of a large cockatoo.  ",1
2671,"Its tibia was 32% smaller than that of a female broad-billed parrot, yet the pectoral bones were of similar size, and proportionally its head was the largest of any Mascarene species of parrot.  ",1
2672,The Rodrigues parrot was similar in skeletal structure to the parrot genera Tanygnathus and Psittacula. ,0
2673,"The pectoral and pelvic bones were similar in size to those of the New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), and it may have looked like the great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) in life, but with a larger head and tail. ",0
2674,"It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several skeletal features, including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards. ",0
2675,"No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism.  ",1
2676,"There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups.  ",1
2677,"Tafforet's 1726 description is the only detailed account of the Rodrigues parrot in life: The largest are larger than a pigeon, and have a tail very long, the head large as well as the beak. ",0
2678,"They mostly come on the islets which are to the south of the island, where they eat a small black seed, which produces a small shrub whose leaves have the smell of the orange tree, and come to the mainland to drink water they have their plumage green.  ",1
2679,"Tafforet also mentioned that the parrots ate the seeds of the shrub Fernelia buxifolia (""bois de buis""), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. ",0
2680,"Due to a large population of introduced rats on Rodrigues, the parrots, the Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus), and the Rodrigues pigeon (Nesoenas rodericanus), frequented and nested on offshore islets, where the rats were absent.  ",1
2681,"Many of the other endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged. ",0
2682,"Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to deforestation. ",0
2683,"The Rodrigues parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), the Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl (Mascarenotus murivorus), the Rodrigues night heron (Nycticorax megacephalus), and the Rodrigues pigeon. ",0
2684,"Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise  (Cylindraspis peltastes), the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis vosmaeri), and the Rodrigues day gecko (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni).  ",1
2685,"Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula eques echo) of Mauritius has survived. ",0
2686,The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. ,0
2687,"Like mainland Rodrigues, the offshore islets were eventually infested by rats, which is believed to have caused the demise of the Rodrigues parrot and other birds there.  ",1
2688,"PingreÌ indicated that local species were popular game, and found that the Rodrigues parrot was rare: The perrucheNewton's parakeet] seemed to me much more delicatethan the flying-fox]. ",0
2689,I would not have missed any game from France if this one had been commoner in Rodrigues; but it begins to become rare. ,0
2690,"There are even fewer perroquetsRodrigues parrots], although there were once a big enough quantity according to FrancÌ§ois Leguat; indeed a little islet south of Rodrigues still retains the name Isle of ParrotsIsle Pierrot].  ",1
2691,PingreÌ also reported that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. ,0
2692,"Along with direct hunting of the parrots, this likely led to a reduction in the population of Rodrigues parrots. ",0
2693,"PingreÌ's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and it probably became extinct soon after.[6The Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), also known as Leguat's gelinote or Leguat's rail, is an extinct species of the rail family  that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. ",0
2694,"It is generally kept in its own genus, Erythromachus, but has sometimes been assigned to the genus Aphanapteryx along with its close relative the red rail (A. bonasia) of Mauritius; their relationship with other rails is unclear. ",0
2695,The Rodrigues rail was about 35 cm (14 in) long and weighed at least 500 g (18 oz). ,0
2696,"It was described as having grey plumage, a red beak, red legs, and a naked red patch around the eye. ",0
2697,"It was described as being attracted to red objects, which humans exploited while hunting it. ",0
2698,The Rodrigues rail is believed to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. ,0
2699,"The bird was first documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts; first by FrancÌ§ois Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and then by Julien Tafforet, marooned on the island in 1726. ",0
2700,"Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts in 1874, and the species was named E. leguati in Leguat's honour. ",0
2701,"In 1848, the English zoologist Hugh Edwin Strickland called attention to a bird mentioned in the French traveller FrancÌ§ois Leguat's 1708 memoir about his stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. ",0
2702,"Leguat referred to the birds as ""gelinottes"" (translated as ""wood-hens""), a name Strickland thought implied the grouse of Europe, though this was not consistent with the form of the beak described by Leguat. ",0
2703,"Strickland was unable to classify the bird further, but noted similarities with the dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and kiwi (Apteryx), based on unidentified birds from Mauritius illustrated by the travellers Pieter van den Broecke and Sir Thomas Herbert, which he thought related. ",0
2704,"Strickland also noted similarities with a bird from Mauritius, which would later be identified as the red rail (Aphanapteryx bonasia).   ",1
2705,"In 1874, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards connected Leguat's account with three subfossil bones (a sternum, a tarsometatarsus, and a fragmentary skull) found in caves of the Plaine Corail region, Rodrigues. ",0
2706,"He recognised their similarity to those of the red rail, while noting it supposedly had a straighter beak (as described by Leguat). ",0
2707,"Milne-Edwards coined the generic name Erythromachus from the Greek words eruthros, ""red"", and makhcÌ§, ""battle"" (also translated as ""hostile to red""), in reference to its attraction to red objects, and the specific name is in honour of Leguat. ",0
2708,The name Erythromachus was incorrectly explained as referring to the Erythraean sea by the American ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond in 1908.    ,1
2709,"The name Miserythrus, from ""red"" and ""hatred"", was used by the English ornithologist Alfred Newton in 1874 (originally only in a manuscript), and also refers to the rail's behaviour towards red, but as a newer name, it is a junior synonym.  ",1
2710,"Milne-Edwards did not select a holotype specimen for the species from the bones he had loaned from Cambridge University Museum of Zoology for his study, but a syntype series was later listed from specimens there, presumably by A. Newton.  ",1
2711,"In 1875, A. Newton also identified a reference to the bird in the 1726 account of the French traveller Julien Tafforet, which had recently been rediscovered.   ",1
2712,"In 1879, more fossils, including skulls, were described by the zoologists Albert GuÌnther and Edward Newton (brother of Alfred), who confirmed that the bird was a rail, and also noted that some specimens had beaks as curved as that of the red rail.  ",1
2713,"In 1921, the American linguist Geoffroy Atkinson questioned the bird's existence, in an article that doubted the veracity of Leguat's memoir.  ",1
2714,"The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that Leguat's description referred to wind-blown purple swamphens (Porphyrio), since the word grey is sometimes used synonymously with blue in old descriptions.  ",1
2715,"Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs represent credible observations of local birds in life.  ",1
2716,"In 1999, the French palaeontologist CeÌcile Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues pointed out that a carpometacarpus bone assigned to the Rodrigues rail and illustrated by GuÌnther and E. Newton in 1879 does not belong to a rail, and therefore not this bird.  ",1
2717,"More subfossils have since been discovered, including an associated but incomplete skeleton with a complete skull and jaws found in Caverne Poule Rouge in 2005.   ",1
2718,"Apart from being a close relative to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx.  GuÌnther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities.  ",1
2719,"In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. ",0
2720,"Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they were related to the genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus.  ",1
2721,"The American ornithologist Bradley C. Livezey was unable to determine the affinities of the Rodrigues and red rail in 1998, stating that some of the features uniting them and some other rails were associated with the loss of flight rather than common descent. ",0
2722,He also suggested that the grouping of the Rodrigues and red rail into the same genus may have been influenced by their geographical distribution.  Mourer-ChauvireÌ and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera.  ,1
2723,"Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. ",0
2724,"According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume in 2008, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. ",0
2725,"These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.  ",1
2726,"In 2019, Hume supported the distinction of the two genera, and cited the relation between the extinct Mauritius owl (Otus sauzieri) and the Rodrigues owl (Otus murivorus) as another example of the diverging evolutionary paths on these islands. ",0
2727,"He stated that the relationships of the Rodrigues and red rails was more unclear than that of other extinct Mascarene rails, with many of their distinct features being related to flightlessness and modifications to their jaws due to their diet, suggesting a long period of isolation. ",0
2728,"He suggested their ancestors could have arrived on the Mascarenes during the middle Miocene at the earliest, but it may have happened more recently. ",0
2729,"The speed with which these features evolved may also have been affected by gene flow, resource availability, and climate events. ",0
2730,"Flightlessness can evolve rapidly in rails, sometimes repeatedly within the same groups, as in Dryolimnas, so the distinctness of the Rodrigues and red rails may not have taken long to evolve; some other specialised rails evolved in less than 1â3 million years. ",0
2731,"Hume suggested that the two rails were probably related to Dryolimnas, but their considerably different morphology made it difficult to establish how. ",0
2732,"In general, rails are adept at colonising islands, and can become flightless within a few generations in environments without predators, yet this also makes them vulnerable to human activities.  ",1
2733,"The Rodrigues rail was about 35 cm (14 in) long, smaller than the red rail, but with proportionally longer wings. ",0
2734,"Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. ",0
2735,"Its beak and legs were red, and it had a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. ",0
2736,"The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and compressed from top to bottom in side-view. ",0
2737,"The cranium was medim-sized among Mascarene rails, 38 mm (1.5 in) long and 20 mm (0.79 in) wide. ",0
2738,"It had a narrow, long frontal region, 6.5 mm (0.26 in) at its least width.     ",1
2739,"The beak was long and curved downwards as in the red rail, but the narial openings were longer. ",0
2740,"The premaxilla that comprised most of the upper bill was long, shallow in side-view, with a narrow nasal bone, and its total length was almost 60% longer than the cranium. ",0
2741,"The culmen of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium. ",0
2742,"The beak was up to 77 mm (3.0 in) long, the lower jaw up to 98 mm (3.9 in) long, and 8 mm (0.31 in) at its greatest depth. ",0
2743,"The narial (nostril) opening was very long, 66% of the rostrum's length. ",0
2744,"There were foramina (openings) on the upper bill, which did not extend to the front edge of the narial opening. ",0
2745,"GuÌnther and Newton stated that the examined beaks varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, while others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. ",0
2746,"The mandible was long and narroe, ending in a sharp point, with the length of the mandibular symphysis (the area where the halves of the mandible meet) being about 65% of the cranium's length. ",0
2747,"The mandible had large, deep set foramina, which ran almost up to a deep sulcus (furrow) at the centre of the mandible.   ",1
2748,These writers were unsure whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism.  ,1
2749,"Livezy was unable to confirm the idea that the differences in the beaks reflected dimorphism in 2003, but thought it probable.  ",1
2750,"Hume examined all available upper beaks in 2019, but found no differences in curvature.  ",1
2751,The bones associated with the forelimbs were generally small in proportion to the bird. ,0
2752,"The scapula (shoulder blade) was small and narrow, and 45 mm (1.8 in) long. ",0
2753,"The coracoid was short but wide, and the sternum was also small. ",0
2754,"The humerus (upper arm bone) was very small, its shaft was curved from top to bottom, and it ranged from 45 to 50 mm (1.8 to 2.0 in). ",0
2755,"The radius and ulna (lower arm bones) were short, and the latter was and strongly arched from top to bottom, ranging from 37 to 42 mm (1.5 to 1.7 in). ",0
2756,"The pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was 57 mm (2.2 in) long, 20 mm (0.79 in) wide at the front, and 36 mm (1.4 in) wide at the back. ",0
2757,"The femur (thigh-bone) was very robust, with a curved shaft, and ranged from 56 to 63 mm (2.2 to 2.5 in) in length. ",0
2758,"The tibiotarsus (lower leg bone) was short but robust, and ranged from 84 to 101 mm (3.3 to 4.0 in). ",0
2759,"The tarsometatarsus was short but very robust, ranging from 52 to 60 mm (2.0 to 2.4 in) long.   ",1
2760,"The proportions of the legs, pelvis and sacrum of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar.   ",1
2761,"The Rodrigues rail differed from the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, as well as a considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.   ",1
2762,"The Dutch ornithologist Marc Herremans suggested in 1989 that the Rodrigues and red rails were neotenic, with juvenile features such as weak pectoral apparatuses and downy plumage.   ",1
2763,The Rodrigues rail was first recorded by Leguat in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies. ,0
2764,"He was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees which were the first to colonise Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain.   ",1
2765,"Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild,  and his full account of the bird reads as follows: Our 'gelinotes' are fat all the year round and of a most delicate taste. ",1
2766,"Their colour is always of a bright grey, and there is very little difference in plumage between the two sexes. ",0
2767,"They hide their nests so well that we could not find them out, and consequently did not taste their eggs. ",0
2768,"They have a red naked area round their eyes, their beaks are straight and pointed, near two and two-fifths inches long, and red also. ",0
2769,"They cannot fly, their fat makes them too heavy for it. ",0
2770,"If you offer them anything red, they are so angry they will fly at you to catch it out of your hand, and in the heat of the combat we had an opportunity to take them with ease.  ",1
2771,"Another description of appearance and behaviour is found in a document called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue attributed to Tafforet, who was marooned on Rodrigues in 1726: There is another kind of bird, the size of a young hen, which has the beak and legs red. ",0
2772,"Its beak is roughly like that of a curlew, except that it is a little deeper and not quite so long. ",0
2773,"They generally feed on the eggs of the land tortoises, which they take from the ground, and makes them so fat that they often have difficulty running. ",0
2774,"They are very good to eat, and their fat is of a yellowish-red, which is excellent for pains. ",0
2775,"They have small pinionswings], without feathers, so they cannot fly; but on the contrary, they run very well. ",0
2776,"Unlike the red rail and other extinct Mascarene birds, the Rodrigues rail was not illustrated by contemporaneous artists. ",0
2777,"When they see somebody pursuing them they produce another sort of noise from their bodies, like that of a person who has hiccups and with the stomach tensed.  ",1
2778,"Olson described reconstructions made for the British zoologist Walter Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds and the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka's 1953 book The Dodo and Kindred Birds as ""rather fanciful"". ",0
2779,"The English artist Frederick William Frohawk based his restoration in the former book on an outline illustration, which was in turn based on a sketch drawn by Herbert, which is now known to depict the red rail.   ",1
2780,"The German zoologist Hermann Schlegel thought it depicted a species of dodo (which he called Didus herbertii) from Rodrigues when he drew the outline in 1854, and that it was the species mentioned by Leguat.  ",1
2781,"According to Tafforet's account, the Rodrigues rail fed on the eggs of the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises, three species of which lived on Rodrigues. ",0
2782,"As it took advantage of their breeding season, Hume considered it an opportunistic predator, which perhaps also fed on hatchling tortoises. ",0
2783,A former tortoise breeding area in the Plaine Corail shows that such sites were concentrated into a small area containing large numbers of eggs; the phalanx bone of a Rodrigues rail has been found among the egg remains. ,0
2784,Sexual dimorphism may have reflected differences in diet between the sexes.  ,1
2785,"The rails would have fattened themselves seasonally, but at other times of the year, they probably fed on snails and other invertebrates, as well as scavenging sea bird colonies. ",0
2786,"The Rodrigues rail probably fed on worms, such as Kontikia whartoni and the now extinct Geonemertes rodericana, by probing leaf-litter or rotting wood.  ",1
2787,"Since Leguat was unable to locate its nests, the Rodrigues rail may have nested outside the easily accessible open forest as was typical in coastal and lowland areas, and rather nested deep in forested valleys or mountainous hills of the interior, according to Hume. ",0
2788,"Its nests may have been well concealed in vegetation on the ground, as is the case of other flightless rails.  ",1
2789,"Like the red rail, it was said to be attracted to the colour red, but the significance of this is unknown.  ",1
2790,"Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem was heavily damaged. ",0
2791,"Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little of those remain today. ",0
2792,"The Rodrigues rail lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul), the Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus), the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron (Nycticorax megacephalus), and the Rodrigues pigeon (Nesoenas rodericanus). ",0
2793,"Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis peltastes), the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis vosmaeri), and the Rodrigues day gecko (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni).  Many terrestrial rails are flightless, and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man-made changes; as a result, rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds. ",1
2794,"All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, caused by human activities. ",0
2795,"For at least a century the Rodrigues rail may have coexisted with rats, which were perhaps introduced by a group of sailors from a Dutch ship marooned there in 1644. ",0
2796,"Though rats were well established and numerous by the time Leguat and Tafforet stayed on the island, the rails also remained common, perhaps due to their aggressive nature.  ",1
2797,"The French began settling Rodrigues in 1735 (to supply Mauritius with tortoise meat), which must have taken a toll on the rails through hunting and deforestation, but their rapid disappearance was probably caused by cats introduced to control the rats around 1750, and the species may have gone extinct within a decade.   ",1
2798,"In 1763, the French astronomer Alexandre Guy PingreÌ noted the absence of this and other birds on Rodrigues by the time of his visit to observe the 1761 transit of Venus: I heard said of neither geÌlinottesRogrigues rail], nor butorsRodrigues night heron], nor alouettessmall waders], nor beÌcassinesshearwaters or petrels]; there may have been some at the time of FrancÌ§ois Leguat, but they have either retreated from their homes or, more likely, the races no longer survive, since the island has been populated with cats.[5 ",0
2799,"The Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. ",0
2800,"Genetically within the family of pigeons and doves, it was most closely related to the also extinct dodo of the nearby island Mauritius, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae. ",0
2801,"Rodrigues solitaires grew to the size of swans, and demonstrated pronounced sexual dimorphism. ",0
2802,"Males were much larger than females and measured up to 90 centimetres (35 inches) in length and 28 kilograms (62 pounds) in weight, contrasting with 70 centimetres (28 in) and 17 kilograms (37 lb) for females. ",0
2803,Its plumage was grey and brown; the female was paler than the male. ,0
2804,"It had a black band at the base of its slightly hooked beak, and its neck and legs were long. ",0
2805,"Both sexes were highly territorial, with large bony knobs on their wings that were used in combat. ",0
2806,The Rodrigues solitaire laid a single egg that was incubated in turn by both sexes. ,0
2807,"Gizzard stones helped digest its food, which included fruit and seeds. ",0
2808,"First mentioned during the 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire was described in detail by FrancÌ§ois Leguat, the leader of a group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691â1693. ",0
2809,"It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. ",0
2810,"Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing was known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1786. ",0
2811,"It is the only extinct bird with a former constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius. ",0
2812,"The French explorer FrancÌ§ois Leguat was the first to refer to the bird as the ""solitaire"" (referring to its solitary habits), but it has been suggested that he borrowed the name from a 1689 tract by his sponsor Marquis Henri Duquesne, which used the name ""solitaire"" in reference to the ReÌunion ibis.  ",1
2813,"The bird was first scientifically named in 1789 as a species of dodo (Didus solitarius, based on Leguat's description) by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in the thirteenth edition of Systema Naturae.  ",1
2814,"In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues solitaire bones encrusted in stalagmite were discovered in a cave and sent to the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in about 1830. ",0
2815,"For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found to belong to the same species.  ",1
2816,The English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848. ,0
2817,"They dissected the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue, comparing it with the few Rodrigues solitaire remains then available.  ",1
2818,"Strickland stated that, although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones otherwise only known in pigeons. ",0
2819,"The fact that the Rodrigues solitaire laid only one egg, fed on fruits, was monogamous and cared for its nestlings also supported this relationship. ",0
2820,"Strickland recognised its generic distinction and named the new genus Pezophaps, from ancient Greek pezos (ÏÎμÎ¶Î¿ÌÏ 'pedestrian') and phaps (ÏÎ±ÌÏ 'pigeon').   ",1
2821,"The differences between the sexes of the bird were so large that Strickland thought they belonged to two species, naming the smaller female bird Pezophaps minor.  ",1
2822,"Additional subfossils were recovered during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was located on the island.  Many of these excavations were requested by the English ornithologists (and brothers) Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. ",1
2823," Study of skeletal features by the Newtons indicated that the solitaire was morphologically intermediate between the dodo and ordinary pigeons, but differed from them in its unique carpal knob.  ",1
2824,"Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. ",1
2825,"Some scientists believed that ReÌunion was home not only to a white dodo, but also to a white bird similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, both of which are now believed to be misinterpretations of old reports of the ReÌunion ibis.  ",1
2826,"An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led the British taxidermist Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, Didus nazarenus; it is now a junior synonym of this species.   ",1
2827,At one point it was suggested that the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans.  ,1
2828,"In spite of the evidence, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. ",0
2829,"In 1921, the American linguist Geoffroy Atkinson claimed Leguat's memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed, and in 1955, the British ecologist George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat. ",0
2830,"Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.    ",1
2831,"For many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. ",0
2832,"Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently.[17 ",0
2833,"] Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.  ",1
2834,"In 2002, American geneticist Beth Shapiro and colleagues analysed the DNA of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire for the first time. ",0
2835,Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from the femur of a Rodrigues solitaire and the tarsal of a dodo confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. ,0
2836,"The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) to be their closest living relative, followed by the crowned pigeons (Goura) of New Guinea, and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris) from Samoa. ",0
2837,"The following cladogram shows the closest relationships of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire within Columbidae, based on Shapiro et al., 2002:   Goura victoria (Victoria crowned pigeon) Caloenas nicobarica (Nicobar pigeon) Pezophaps solitaria ",1
2838,"(Rodrigues solitaire) Raphus cucullatus (dodo) Didunculus strigirostris (tooth-billed pigeon) A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Didunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) at the base of the clade.  ",1
2839,"Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence.  ",1
2840,"In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.  ",1
2841,The 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the PaleogeneâNeogene boundary. ,0
2842,"The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, ReÌunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. ",0
2843,"Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage.  ",1
2844,"The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed at the base of a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. ",0
2845,This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia.  ,1
2846,The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes.  ,1
2847,The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius.  ,1
2848,"Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. ",0
2849,"It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.  ",1
2850,"The beak of the Rodrigues solitaire was slightly hooked, and its neck and legs were long.  ",1
2851,"The skull was 170 mm (6.7 in) long, flattened at the top with the fore and hind parts elevated into two bony ridges structured with cancellous bone.  ",1
2852,"A black band (a contemporary description described it as a ""frontlet"") appeared on its head just behind the base of the beak. ",0
2853,The plumage of the Rodrigues solitaire was described as grey and brown. ,0
2854,Females were paler than males and had light-coloured elevations on the lower neck.  Sexual size dimorphism in this species is perhaps the greatest in any neognath bird.  ,1
2855,"Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90 cm (35 in) in length and weighing up to 28 kg (62 lb), whereas females were 70 cm (28 in) and weighed 17 kg (37 lb).  ",1
2856,This is only 60% of the weight of a mature male.  ,1
2857,"Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21 kg in males and 13 kg in females.  ",1
2858,"Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. ",0
2859,"Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.[31 ",0
2860,] Members of both sexes possessed a large tuberous knob of bone exostosis situated at the base of the carpometacarpus of each wrist. ,0
2861,"The knob was cauliflower-like in appearance, and consisted of up to two or three lobes. ",0
2862,"The knobs were about half the length of the metacarpus, were larger in males than females, and described as the size of a musket ball. ",0
2863,One study measured the largest knob to be 32.9 millimetres (1.30 in) in diameter. ,0
2864,"The knobs vary in size across individuals, and were entirely absent from 58% of specimens examined for the study. ",0
2865,"These are thought to be immature birds, or birds without territory. ",0
2866,"The carpometacarpi of males without the knobs were smaller on average than those with it, but there was little difference between the females. ",0
2867,"In life, the knobs would have been covered by tough cartilaginous or keratinous integument, which would have made them appear even larger. ",0
2868,Carpal spurs and knobs are also known from other extant as well as extinct birds. ,0
2869,"Within Columbidae, the crowned pigeons and the Viti Levu giant pigeon have outgrowths on the carpometacarpus which are similar to those of the female Rodrigues solitaire. ",0
2870,"Other well known examples are the steamer ducks, the torrent duck, sheathbills, screamers, the spur-winged goose, and the extinct Jamaican ibis, Xenicibis xympithecus.  ",1
2871,"The Rodrigues solitaire shared traits with the dodo, its closest relative, such as size and features in the skull, pelvis, and sternum. ",0
2872,"It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof, and larger orbits. ",0
2873,"Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. ",0
2874,Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. ,0
2875,"Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). ",0
2876,"However, the skull, trunk, and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.  ",1
2877,"Apart from Leguat's rather simple depiction, the life appearance of the Rodrigues solitaire is only known from a handful of descriptions; no soft-tissue remains survive.  ",1
2878,"Leguat devoted three pages of his memoirs to the Rodrigues solitaire, and was clearly impressed by the bird.  ",1
2879,"He described its appearance as follows: Of all the Birds in the Island the most remarkable is that which goes by the name of the solitary, because it is very seldom seen in company, tho' there are abundance of them.  ",0
2880,"The Feathers of the Males are of a brown grey Colour: the Feet and Beak are like a Turkey's, but a little more crooked. ",0
2881,"They have scarce any Tail, but their Hind-part covered with Feathers is roundish, like the Crupperrump] of a horse; they are taller than Turkeys. ",0
2882,"Their Neck is straight, and a little longer in proportion than a Turkey's when it lifts up his Head. ",0
2883,"Its Eye is Black and lively, and its Head without Comb or Cop. ",0
2884,"They never fly, their Wings are too little to support the Weight of their Bodies; they serve only to beat themselves, and flutter when they call one another. ",0
2885,"They will whirl about for twenty or thirty times together on the same side, during the space of four or five minutes. ",0
2886,The motion of their Wings makes then a noise very like that of a Rattle; and one may hear it two hundred Paces off. ,0
2887,"The Bone of their Wing grows greater towards the Extremity, and forms a little round Mass under the Feathers, as big as a Musket Ball. ",0
2888,"Tis very hard to catch it in the Woods, but easie in open Places, because we run faster than they, and sometimes we approach them without much Trouble. ",0
2889,"From March to September they are extremely fat, and taste admirably well, especially while they are young, some of the Males weigh forty-five Pounds.  ",1
2890,Several of Leguat's observations were later confirmed through study of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire remains. ,0
2891,"The curved contour lines of the pelvis also support the roundness of its hind parts, which he compared to that of a horse. ",0
2892,"Also, a ridged surface appears at the base of the beak, indicating the position of the caruncular ridge, which Leguat described as a ""widow's peak"".  ",1
2893,"Before fossils of the carpal knob were found, Strickland noted that the keel of the sternum of the Rodrigues solitaire was so well-developed as to almost indicate it had possessed the power of flight; however, since the humerus was very short he inferred that this was instead related to Leguat's claim that they used their wings for defence.  ",1
2894,"Leguat continued with an elaborate description of the female Rodrigues solitaire, which also appears to be the sex depicted in his illustration of the bird: ",0
2895,"The Females are wonderfully beautiful, some fair, some brown; I call them fair, because they are the colour of fair Hair. ",0
2896,"They have a sort of Peak, like a Widow's upon their Breastsbeaks], which is of a dun colour. ",0
2897,"No one Feather is straggling from the other all over their Bodies, they being very careful to adjust themselves, and make them all even with their Beaks. ",0
2898,"The Feathers on their Thighs are round like Shells at the end, and being there very thick, have an agreeable effect. ",0
2899,"They have two Risings on their Crawscrop] and the Feathers are whiter than the rest, which livelily represents the fine neck of a Beautiful Woman. ",0
2900,"They walk with so much Stateliness and good Grace, that one cannot help admiring them and loving them; by which means their fine Mein often saves their Lives.  ",1
2901,"It has been proposed that Leguat's comparison between the crop of the female Rodrigues solitaire and the ""beautiful bosom of a woman"" (changed to ""fine neck"" in some editions of his memoirs) was out of longing for female companionship.   ",1
2902,"Leguat's statements were confirmed by another description by Julien Tafforet, who wrote in 1726: ",0
2903,"The solitaire is a large bird, which weighs about forty or fifty pounds. ",0
2904,"They have a very big head, with a sort of frontlet, as if of black velvet. ",0
2905,"Their feathers are neither feathers nor fur; they are of light grey colour, with a little black on their backs. ",0
2906,"Strutting proudly about, either alone or in pairs, they preen their plumage or fur with their beak, and keep themselves very clean. ",0
2907,"They have their toes furnished with hard scales, and run with quickness, mostly among the rocks, where a man, however agile, can hardly catch them. ",0
2908,"They have a very short beak, of about an inch in length, which is sharp. ",0
2909,"They, nevertheless, do not attempt to hurt anyone, except when they find someone before them, and, when hardly pressed, try to bite him. ",0
2910, Observations of the Rodrigues solitaire in life indicate that they were highly territorial. ,0
2911,"They have a small stump of a wing, which has a sort of bullet at its extremity, and serves as a defence. ",1
2912,"They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists.  ",1
2913,Fractures in their wing bones also indicate that they were used in combat.  ,1
2914,It has also been suggested that these fractures may have been the result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries.  ,1
2915,"But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. ",0
2916,"Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. ",0
2917,"Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour.  ",1
2918,Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.  ,1
2919,"In addition to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. ",0
2920,"The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. ",0
2921,"The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be the size of the territory of an individual. ",0
2922,"Other species of birds (e.g., club-winged manakin) are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.  ",1
2923,"In 1869, the Newton brothers suggested that the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone.  ",1
2924,It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. ,0
2925,"This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. ",0
2926,"If such a disease was due to inbreeding, it would also be present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. ",0
2927,The authors instead suggested that the wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. ,0
2928,"This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. ",0
2929,"It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.  ",1
2930,"Some evidence, including their large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the Rodrigues solitaire may have had a protracted development period. ",0
2931,"Based on mass estimates, it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 28, and the female 17.  ",1
2932,"The French economist Pierre-AndreÌ d'HeÌguerty, writing about his time on the island around 1735, stated that a captive Rodrigues solitaire (which he described as having a melancholic appearance) would always walk in the same line until running out of space, and then return.  ",1
2933,"The species may have lived primarily in the island's woodlands, rather than on the shores.  ",1
2934,"Many other of the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged. ",0
2935,"Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to deforestation. ",0
2936,"The Rodrigues solitaire lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. ",0
2937,"Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.  ",1
2938,"Leguat stated that the Rodrigues solitaire fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. ",0
2939,"It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. ",0
2940,"It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk.  ",1
2941,The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. ,0
2942,"If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. ",0
2943,It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.  ,1
2944,Several contemporary accounts state that the Rodrigues solitaire used gizzard stones. ,0
2945,"Leguat described the stones in the following passage, mentioning that Rodrigues solitaires refused to feed in captivity: Tho' these Birds will sometimes very familiarly come up near enough to one, when we do not run after them, yet they will never grow Tame. ",0
2946,"As soon as they are caught they shed Tears without Crying, and refuse all sustenance till they die. ",0
2947,"We find in the Gizzards of both Male and Female, a brown Stone, of the bigness of a Hen's Egg, 'tis somewhat rough, flat on one side and round on the other, heavy and hard. ",0
2948,"We believe this Stone was there when they were hatched, for let them be never so young, you meet with it always. ",0
2949,"They never have but one of 'em, and besides, the Passage from the Craw to the Gizard is so narrow, that a like Mass of half Bigness cou'd not pass. ",0
2950,It serv'd to whet our Knives better than any other Stone Whatsoever.  ,1
2951,"In 1877 three stones were found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues solitaire skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. ",0
2952,"One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, c. 50 g (1 3â4 oz), but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. ",0
2953,This could be due to its association with a young individual.  ,1
2954,"Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.  ",1
2955,The most detailed account of the reproductive habits of the Rodrigues solitaire is Leguat's. ,0
2956,"When these Birds build their Nests, they choose a clean Place, gather together some Palm-Leaves for that purpose, and heap them up a foot and a half high from the Ground, on which they sit. ",0
2957,"They never lay but one Egg, which is much bigger than that of a Goose. ",0
2958,"The Male and Female both cover it in their turns, and the young is not hatch'd till at seven Weeks' end: All the while they are sitting upon it, or are bringing up their young one, which is not able to provide itself in several Months, they will not suffer any other Bird of their Species to come within two hundred Yards round of the Place; But what is very singular, is, the Males will never drive away the Females, only when he perceives one he makes a noise with his Wings to call to the Female, and she drives the unwelcome Stranger away, not leaving it till 'tis without her Bounds. ",0
2959,"The Female do's the same as to the Males, whom she leaves to the Male, and he drives them away. ",0
2960,"We have observ'd this several Times, and I affirm it to be true. ",0
2961,"The Combats between them on this occasion last sometimes pretty long, because the Stranger only turns about, and do's not fly directly from the Nest. ",0
2962,"However, the others do not forsake it till they have quite driven it out of their Limits. ",0
2963,"After these Birds have rais'd their young One, and left it to itself, they are always together, which the other Birds are not, and tho' they happen to mingle with other Birds of the same Species, these two Companions never disunite. ",0
2964,"We have often remark'd, that some Days after the young leaves the Nest, a Company of thirty or forty brings another young one to it, and the now fledg'd Bird, with its Father and Mother joyning with the Band, march to some bye Place. ",0
2965,"We frequently follow'd them, and found that afterwards the old ones went each their way alone, or in Couples, and left the two young ones together, which we call'd a Marriage.  ",1
2966,"The clutch was described as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. ",0
2967,"The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed creÌches, which may have followed foraging adults as part of the learning process.  ",1
2968,A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.  ,1
2969,"Tafforet's account confirms Leguat's description of reproductive behaviour, adding that Rodrigues solitaires would even attack humans approaching their chicks: They do not fly at all, having no feathers to their wings, but they flap them, and make a great noise with their wings when angry, and the noise is something like thunder in the distance. ",0
2970,"They only ly, as I am led to suppose, but once in the year, and only one egg. ",0
2971,"Not that I have seen their eggs, for I have not been able to discover where they lay. ",0
2972,"But I have never seen but one little one alone with them, and, if any one tried to approach it, they would bite him very severely. ",0
2973,"These birds live on seeds and leaves of trees, which they pick up on the ground. ",0
2974,"They have a gizzard larger than the fist, and what is surprising is that there is found in it a stone of the size of a henn's egg, of oval shape, a little flattened, although this animal cannot swallow anything larger than a small cherry-stone. ",0
2975,"The size difference between sexes has led to the suggestion that the Rodrigues solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this deeply religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons.  ",1
2976,"It has been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive mating ",0
2977,"However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; most other pigeons are monogamous as well.  ",1
2978,"A 2015 article proposed that males invited females into their territories as secondary mates, which would result in the resident female acting aggressively towards the newcomer. ",0
2979,"The territories probably provided all the food the birds needed in addition to acting as breeding-areas, and there was probably intense competition for favourable territories. ",0
2980,"The fact that Rodrigues island shrank by 90% at the end of the Pleistocene may also have contributed to such competition over territories, and thereby furthered sexual dimorphism.  ",1
2981,"The Dutch viceadmiral Hans Hendricksz Bouwer was the first to list ""dodos"", most likely referring to the Rodrigues solitaire, as part of the fauna of Rodrigues in 1601.  ",1
2982,"The English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert mentioned ""dodos"" on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also mentioned in 1700.  ",1
2983,"The next account, which was the first referring to the bird as the ""solitaire"", was published in FrancÌ§ois Leguat's 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies.  ",1
2984,"Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees, who were the first to colonise the island from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. ",0
2985,"His description of the Rodrigues solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, and he also described other species that are now extinct. ",0
2986,Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. ,0
2987,"He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe dodos there. ",0
2988,"The Huguenots praised the Rodrigues solitaires for their flavour, especially that of the young, and used their gizzard stones as knife sharpeners. ",0
2989,"D'HeÌguerty later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as bezoars.   ",1
2990,"The second most detailed description of the bird was found in an anonymous document rediscovered in 1874 called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue, which has been attributed to Julien Tafforet, a mariner marooned on Rodrigues in 1726. ",0
2991,"His observations are considered credible, though it is known he had a copy of Leguat's memoirs with him during his stay.  ",1
2992,Many old accounts mention that Rodrigues solitaires were hunted by man. ,0
2993,"The Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup noted that some Rodrigues solitaire remains bore traces of having been broken by man or perhaps another large predator, to extract bone marrow.  Writing in 1735, the French lieutenant Gennes de la ChancelieÌre described the capture and consumption of two specimens as follows: Our men told of having seen goats and a large quantity of birds of different kinds: they brought, amongst others, two of which were bigger by a third than the largest turkey; they appeared, nevertheless to be still quite young, still having down on the neck and head; their wingtips were but sparsely feathered, without any proper tail. ",1
2994,"Three sailors told me of having seen two others, of the same species, as big as the biggest ostrich. ",0
2995,"The young ones that were brought had the head made more or less like the latter animal, but their feet were similar to those of turkeys, instead of that of the ostrich which is forked and cloven in the shape of a hind's foot. ",0
2996,"These two birds, when skinned, had an inch of fat on the body. ",0
2997,"One was made into a pie, which turned out to be so tough that it was uneatable.  ",1
2998,"Unlike the dodo, no Rodrigues solitaires are known to have been sent to Europe alive. ",0
2999,"However, it has been claimed that the French naval officer Bertrand-FrancÌ§ois ",0
3000,"MaheÌ de La Bourdonnais sent a ""solitaire"" to France from the nearby island of ReÌunion around 1740. ",0
3001,"Since the ReÌunion solitaire is believed to have become extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues solitaire.  ",1
3002,The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. ,0
3003,"Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks.  ",1
3004,"In 1755, the French engineer Joseph-FrancÌ§ois Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, as he had been assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. ",0
3005,"Though trying for 18 months, and offering large rewards, none could be found. ",0
3006,"He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead.  ",1
3007,"The French astronomer Alexandre Guy PingreÌ did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, although he had been assured they survived. ",0
3008,"His friend, the French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey. ",0
3009,"Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depicted other birds.  ",1
3010,"By the time the discovery of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire bones from 1786 onwards confirmed Leguat's descriptions, no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. ",0
3011,"In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. ",0
3012,"Rodrigues covers only 104 square kilometres (40 sq mi), making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.[29 ",0
3013,The Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus) is an extinct species of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. ,0
3014,Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three are extinct and appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. ,0
3015,"The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. ",0
3016,"Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. ",0
3017,There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century. ,0
3018,"The Rodrigues starling was 25â30 centimetres (10â12 inches) long, and had a stout beak. ",0
3019,"It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. ",0
3020,"Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. ",0
3021,Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. ,0
3022,"It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on IÌle Gombrani, its last refuge. ",0
3023,"In 1725, the French sailor Julien Tafforet was marooned on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as Relation d'iÌle Rodrigue. ",0
3024,"In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. ",0
3025,"He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of IÌle Gombrani, which was then called au MaÌt. ",0
3026,"FrancÌ§ois Leguat, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.   ",1
3027,No people who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird.  ,1
3028,"In an article written in 1875, the British ornithologist Alfred Newton attempted to identify the bird from Tafforet's description, and hypothesised that it was related to the extinct hoopoe starling (Fregilupus varius), which formerly inhabited nearby ReÌunion.  Subfossil bones of a starling-like bird were first discovered on Rodrigues by the police magistrate George Jenner In 1866 and 1871, and by the British naturalist Henry H. Slater in 1874. ",1
3029,"They were found in caves on the Plaine Coral, a limestone plain in south-west Rodrigues.  ",1
3030,"These bones included the cranium, mandible, sternum, coracoid, humerus, metacarpus, ulna, femur, tibia, and metatarsus of several birds; the bones were deposited in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum. ",0
3031,"In 1879, the bones became the basis of a scientific description of the bird by ornithologists Albert GuÌnther and Edward Newton (the brother of Alfred).  ",1
3032," GuÌnther and Newton determined that the Rodrigues starling was closely related to the hoopoe starling, and they only kept it in a separate genus due to what they termed ""present ornithological practice"". ",0
3033,"They named the bird Necropsar rodericanus; Nekros and psar are Greek for ""dead"" and ""starling"", while rodericanus refers to the island of Rodrigues. ",0
3034, BirdLife International credits Slater rather than GuÌnther and Newton for the name. ,1
3035,"Slater had prepared the manuscript for an 1879 publication, which was never released, but GuÌnther and Newton quoted Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. ",1
3036,This binomial was originally proposed by Slater in an 1874 manuscript he sent to GuÌnther and Newton.  ,1
3037,"Due to the strongly built bill, they considered the new species likely the same as the bird mentioned in Tafforet's account.  ",1
3038,"In 1900, the English scientist George Ernest Shelley used the spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; he attributed the name to zoologist Philip Sclater.  ",1
3039,"In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species.  ",1
3040,More subfossils found in 1974 added support to the claim that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling.  ,1
3041,The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus.  ,1
3042,"In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. ",0
3043,"It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus.  ",1
3044,"Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.  ",1
3045,"Hume noted that GuÌnther and Newton had not designated a holotype specimen among the fossils they based the specific name on, and chose the skull from their syntype series of bones as the lectotype; specimen NMHUK A9050, housed at the Natural History Museum, London. ",0
3046,"Hume also identified other bones depicted by GuÌnther and Newton among museum collections, and designated them as paralectotypes.  ",1
3047,"In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes described a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, based on a skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. ",0
3048,"He suggested that this was the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues.  ",1
3049,Walter Rothschild believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius.  ,1
3050,"In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar.  ",1
3051,"In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.  ",1
3052,"Hachisuka believed the carnivorous habits described by Tafforet to be unlikely for a starling, and thought the lack of a crest suggested that it was not closely related to Fregilupus. ",0
3053,"He was reminded of corvids because of the black-and-white plumage, and assumed the bird seen by Tafforet was a sort of chough. ",0
3054,"In 1937, he named it Testudophaga bicolor, with Testudophaga meaning ""tortoise eater"", and coined the common name ""bi-coloured chough"".  ",1
3055,"Hachisuka's assumptions are disregarded today, and modern ornithologists find Tafforet's bird to be identical to the one described from subfossil remains.    ",1
3056,"In 1987, the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles prepared a manuscript that described a new species of Old World babbler, Rodriguites microcarina, based on an incomplete sternum found in a cave on Rodrigues. ",0
3057,"In 1989, the name was mistakenly published before the description, making it a nomen nudum. ",0
3058,Later examination of the sternum by Hume showed that Rodriguites microcarina was identical to the Rodrigues starling.  ,1
3059,"In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon suggested that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and given rise to the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. ",0
3060,"According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds.   ",1
3061,"A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.  ",1
3062,"Extant East Asian starlings, such as the Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed starling (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. ",0
3063,"As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. ",0
3064,"Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. ",0
3065,"This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.  ",1
3066,"The Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being 25â30 cm (10â12 in) in length. ",0
3067,"Its body was white or greyish white, with blackish-brown wings, and a yellow bill and legs. ",1
3068,"One sees it on the islet au MaÌtIle Gombrani], which is to the south of the main island, and I believe it keeps to that islet on account of the birds of prey which are on the mainland, as also to feed with more facility on the eggs of the fishing birds which feed there, for they feed on nothing else but eggs or turtles dead of hunger, which they well know how to tear out of their shells. ",0
3069,"These birds are a little larger than a blackbirdReÌunion bulbul (Hypsipetes borbonicus)], and have white plumage, part of the wings and tail black, the beak yellow as well as the feet, and make a wonderful warbling. ",0
3070,"I say a warbling, since they have many and altogether different notes. ",0
3071,"We brought up some with cooked meat, cut up very small, which they eat in preference to seed.    ",1
3072,"Tafforet was familiar with the fauna of ReÌunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. ",0
3073,"He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. ",0
3074,"The skull of the Rodrigues starling was similar to and about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. ",0
3075,"Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. ",0
3076,"The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. ",0
3077,"The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.  ",1
3078,Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic.  ,1
3079,"Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. ",0
3080,"There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.  ",1
3081,"Compared to the other Mascarene starlings, the skull of the Rodrigues starling was relatively compressed from top to bottom, and it had a wide frontal bone. ",0
3082,"The skull was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about 29 mm (1.1 in) long from the occipital condyle; it was also narrower, being 21â22 mm (0.83â0.87 in) wide. ",0
3083,"The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the eye sockets were about 8 mm (0.31 in) apart. ",0
3084,"The interorbital septum was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. ",0
3085,"The bill was about 36â39 mm (1.4â1.5 in) long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. ",0
3086,"The rostrum (bony beak) of the upper jaw was long and relatively wide, and the premaxilla (the frontmost bone of the upper jaw) was robust and relatively straight. ",0
3087,"The bony nasal openings were large and oval, measuring 12â13 mm (0.47â0.51 in) in length. ",0
3088,"The rostrum of the lower mandible was wide and sharp, and relatively deep and robust at the back, wih a robust retroarticular process (the hind part that connected with the skull) that was directed towards the midline. ",0
3089,The mandible was about 52â60 mm (2.0â2.4 in) long and 4â5 mm (0.16â0.20 in) deep at the back. ,0
3090,"The supraoccipital ridge on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a biventer muscle attachment in the parietal region below it was conspicuous. ",0
3091,This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.   ,1
3092,"The coracoid of the Rodrigues starling was small, relatively gracile, and was otherwise identical to that of the hoopoe starling, measuring 27.5 mm (1.08 in). ",0
3093,"The keel of the sternum (breast-bone) was similar to that of the hoopoe starling, though the front part was 1 mm lower. ",0
3094,"The wing and leg bones did not differ much from those of the hoopoe starling and other starlings; the length of the forearm of the hoopoe starling was somewhat longer relatively to the humerus than that of the Rodrigues starling, while other measurements were roughly the same. ",0
3095,"The humerus was gracile and had a curved shaft, and measured 32â35 mm (1.3â1.4 in). ",0
3096,"The ulna was small, relatively gracile, and had distinct quill knobs (where the secondary remige feathers attached). ",0
3097,"The ulna was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring 37â40 mm (1.5â1.6 in). ",0
3098,"The femur (thigh-bone) was large and robust, particularly ant the upper and lower ends, and it shaft was was straight and expanded at the upper end. ",0
3099,"The tibiotarsus (lower leg bone) was large, robust, with a broad and expanded shaft, and was 52â59 mm (2.0â2.3 in) long. ",0
3100,"The tarsometatarsus (ankle bone) was long, robust, with a relatively straight shaft, and measured 36â41 mm (1.4â1.6 in).   ",1
3101,"Little is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. ",0
3102,The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. ,0
3103,"Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. ",0
3104,"Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.  ",1
3105,"Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. ",0
3106,"Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. ",0
3107,The stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible suggest that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. ,0
3108,"It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. ",0
3109,This ability supports Tafforet's observation that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.  ,1
3110,"It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. ",0
3111,"Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on IÌle Gombrani.  ",1
3112,"Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.  ",1
3113,"Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is now heavily damaged. ",0
3114,"Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. ",0
3115,"The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. ",0
3116,"Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.  ",1
3117,"Leguat mentioned that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. ",0
3118,This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. ,0
3119,"By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. ",0
3120,"Rats - constituting an Invasive species - could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. ",0
3121,"The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. ",0
3122,The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy PingreÌ visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.  ,1
3123,"The large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. ",0
3124,The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. ,0
3125,"Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. ",0
3126,The ruff (Calidris pugnax) is a medium-sized wading bird that breeds in marshes and wet meadows across northern Eurasia. ,0
3127,"At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.  ",1
3128,"This highly gregarious sandpiper is migratory and sometimes forms huge flocks in its winter grounds, which include southern and western Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australia. ",0
3129,"This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; the male is much larger than the female (the reeve), and has a breeding plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. ",0
3130,The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. ,0
3131,"Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. ",0
3132,"The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. ",0
3133,"Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas. ",0
3134,"The ruff forages in wet grassland and soft mud, probing or searching by sight for edible items. ",0
3135,"It primarily feeds on insects, especially in the breeding season, but it will consume plant material, including rice and maize, on migration and in winter. ",0
3136,"Classified as ""least concern"" on the IUCN Red List criteria, the global conservation concerns are relatively low because of the large numbers that breed in Scandinavia and the Arctic. ",0
3137,"However, the range in much of Europe is contracting because of land drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of mown or grazed breeding sites, and over-hunting. ",0
3138,This decline has seen it listed in the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). ,0
3139,"The ruff is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae, the typical shorebirds. ",0
3140,"Recent research suggests that its closest relatives are the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata.  ",1
3141,It was moved to the monotypic genus Philomachus by German naturalist Blasius Merrem in 1804. ,1
3142,This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Tringa pugnax.  ,1
3143,More recent DNA research has shown it fits comfortably into the wader genus Calidris.  ,1
3144,"The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek kalidris or skalidris, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds.  ",1
3145,"The original English name for this bird, dating back to at least 1465, is the ree, perhaps derived from a dialectical term meaning ""frenzied"";  a later name reeve, which is still used for the female, is of unknown origin, but may be derived from the shire-reeve, a feudal officer, likening the male's flamboyant plumage to the official's robes. ",1
3146,"The specific epithet refers to the aggressive behaviour of the bird at its mating arenas â pugnax from the Latin term for ""combative"".  ",1
3147,"The current name was first recorded in 1634, and is derived from the ruff, an exaggerated collar fashionable from the mid-sixteenth century to the mid-seventeenth century, since the male bird's neck ornamental feathers resemble the neck-wear.  ",1
3148,"The ruff has a distinctive gravy boat appearance, with a small head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. ",0
3149,It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. ,0
3150,"In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals on the sides of the tail. ",1
3151,"Although a small percentage of males resemble females,  the typical male is much larger than the female and has an elaborate breeding plumage. ",1
3152,"He is 29â32 cm (11â13 in) long with a 54â60 cm (21â24 in) wingspan,  and weighs about 180 g (6.3 oz).  ",1
3153,"In the May-to-June breeding season, the typical male's legs, bill and warty bare facial skin are orange, and he has distinctive head tufts and a neck ruff. ",0
3154,"These ornaments vary on individual birds, being black, chestnut or white, with the colouring solid, barred or irregular.  ",1
3155,"The grey-brown back has a scale-like pattern, often with black or chestnut feathers, and the underparts are white with extensive black on the breast.  ",1
3156," Outside the breeding season, the typical male's head and neck decorations and the bare facial skin are lost and the legs and bill become duller. ",0
3157,"The extreme variability of the main breeding plumage is thought to have developed to aid individual recognition in a species that has communal breeding displays, but is usually mute. ",1
3158,"The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.  ",1
3159,"The female, or ""reeve"", is 22â26 cm (8.7â10.2 in) long with a 46â49 cm (18â19 in) wingspan,  and weighs about 110 g (3.9 oz).  ",1
3160,"In breeding plumage, she has grey-brown upperparts with white-fringed, dark-centred feathers. ",0
3161,"In winter, her plumage is similar to that of the male, but the sexes are distinguishable on size.  ",1
3162,"Typical adult male ruffs start to moult into the main display plumage before their return to the breeding areas, and the proportion of birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. ",0
3163,"The plumage of the juvenile ruff resembles the non-breeding adult, but has upperparts with a neat, scale-like pattern with dark feather centres, and a strong buff tinge to the underparts.  ",1
3164,"Ruffs of both sexes have an additional moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. ",0
3165,"They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.  ",1
3166,"Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. ",0
3167,Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. ,0
3168,"The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. ",0
3169," Adult males and most adult females start their pre-winter moult before returning south, but complete most feather replacement on the wintering grounds. ",0
3170,"The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures. ",1
3171,"In Kenya, males moult 3â4 weeks ahead of the females, finishing before December, whereas females typically complete feather replacement during December and early January. ",0
3172,"Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing and duration to that of the adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.  Two other waders can be confused with the ruff. ",1
3173,"The juvenile sharp-tailed sandpiper is a little smaller than a juvenile female ruff and has a similar rich orange-buff breast, but the ruff is slimmer with a longer neck and legs, a rounder head, and a much plainer face.  ",1
3174,"The buff-breasted sandpiper also resembles a small juvenile ruff, but even the female ruff is noticeably larger than the sandpiper, with a longer bill, more rotund body and scaly-patterned upperparts.  ",1
3175,"The ruff is a migratory species, breeding in wetlands in colder regions of northern Eurasia, and spends the northern winter in the tropics, mainly in Africa. ",0
3176,"Some Siberian breeders undertake an annual round trip of up to 30,000 km (19,000 mi) to the West African wintering grounds.  ",1
3177,There is a limited overlap of the summer and winter ranges in western Europe.  ,1
3178,The ruff breeds in extensive lowland freshwater marshes and damp grasslands.  ,1
3179,"It avoids barren tundra and areas badly affected by severe weather, preferring hummocky marshes and deltas with shallow water. ",0
3180,"The wetter areas provide a source of food, the mounds and slopes may be used for leks, and dry areas with sedge or low scrub offer nesting sites.  ",1
3181,"A Hungarian study showed that moderately intensive grazing of grassland, with more than one cow per hectare (2.5 acres), was found to attract more nesting pairs.  ",1
3182,"When not breeding, the birds use a wider range of shallow wetlands, such as irrigated fields, lake margins, and mining subsidence and other floodlands. ",0
3183,"Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used.  ",1
3184,"The density can reach 129 individuals per square kilometre (334 per square mile), but is usually much lower.  ",1
3185,The ruff breeds in Europe and Asia from Scandinavia and Great Britain almost to the Pacific. ,0
3186,"In Europe it is found in cool temperate areas, but over its Russian range it is an Arctic species, occurring mainly north of about 65 Â°N.",0
3187,"The largest numbers breed in Russia (more than 1 million pairs), Sweden (61,000 pairs), Finland (39,000 pairs) and Norway (14,000 pairs). ",0
3188,"Although it also breeds from Britain east through the Low Countries to Poland, Germany and Denmark, there are fewer than 2,000 pairs in these more southerly areas.  ",1
3189,"It is highly gregarious on migration, travelling in large flocks that can contain hundreds or thousands of individuals. ",0
3190,Huge dense groups form on the wintering grounds;  one flock in Senegal contained a million birds.  ,1
3191,"In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year.  ",1
3192,Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical wintering quarters. ,0
3193,"The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand.   ",1
3194,"It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern Kazakhstan, a major migration stopover area.   ",1
3195,"The male, which plays no part in nesting or chick care, leaves the breeding grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. ",1
3196," Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males,  whereas in Kenya most are females.  ",1
3197,"Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. ",0
3198,Birds returning north in spring across the central Mediterranean appear to follow a well-defined route. ,0
3199,Male ruffs may also be able to tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.  ,1
3200,"Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. ",0
3201,"The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites.  ",1
3202,"The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as the main energy source for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.  Males display during the breeding season at a lek in a traditional open grassy arena. ",1
3203,"The ruff is one of the few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour.   ",1
3204,"There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. ",0
3205,"The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see Â§Biology of variation among males). ",0
3206,"The territorial males, about 84% of the total, have strongly coloured black or chestnut ruffs and stake out and occupy small mating territories in the lek. ",0
3207,"They actively court females and display a high degree of aggression towards other resident males;  5â20 territorial males each hold an area of the lek about 1 m (1.1 yd) across, usually with bare soil in the centre. ",1
3208,"They perform an elaborate display that includes wing fluttering, jumping, standing upright, crouching with ruff erect, or lunging at rivals.  ",1
3209,"They are typically silent even when displaying, although a soft gue-gue-gue may occasionally be given.  ",1
3210,"Territorial males are very site-faithful; 90% return to the same lekking sites in subsequent seasons, the most dominant males being the most likely to reappear. ",0
3211,"Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. ",0
3212,"Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. ",0
3213,Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.  ,1
3214,"Satellite males, about 16% of the total number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories occupied by the resident males.  ",1
3215,"Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females.   ",1
3216,"Females also prefer larger leks,  and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.  ",1
3217,"Although satellite males are on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. ",0
3218,"Resident-type chicks will, if provided with the same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. ",0
3219,"Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they do not need to be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.  ",1
3220,"A third type of male was first described in 2006; this is a permanent female mimic, the first such reported for a bird. ",0
3221,"About 1% of males are small, intermediate in size between males and females, and do not grow the elaborate breeding plumage of the territorial and satellite males, although they have much larger internal testes than the ruffed males.  ",1
3222,"Although the males of most lekking bird species have relatively small testes for their size, male ruffs have the most disproportionately large testes of any bird.  ",1
3223,"This cryptic male, or ""faeder"" (Old English ""father"") obtains access to mating territories together with the females, and ""steals"" matings when the females crouch to solicit copulation.  ",1
3224,"The faeder moults into the prenuptial male plumage with striped feathers, but does not go on to develop the ornamental feathers of the normal male. ",0
3225,"As described above, this stage is thought to show the original male breeding plumage, before other male types evolved. ",0
3226,"A faeder can be distinguished in the hand by its wing length, which is intermediate between those of displaying males and females.  ",1
3227,"Despite their feminine appearance, the faeders migrate with the larger 'normal' lekking males and spend the winter with them. The faeders are sometimes mounted by independent or satellite males, but are as often ""on top"" in homosexual mountings as the ruffed males, suggesting that their true identity is known by the other males. ",1
3228,"Females often seem to prefer mating with faeders to copulation with normal males, and normal males also copulate with faeders (and vice versa) relatively more often than with females. ",0
3229,"The homosexual copulations may attract females to the lek, like the presence of satellite males.  ",1
3230,"Not all mating takes place at the lek, since only a minority of the males attend an active lek. ",0
3231,"As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females (""following"") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites (""intercepting""). ",0
3232,"Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. ",0
3233,Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.  ,1
3234,The level of polyandry in the ruff is the highest known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. ,0
3235,"More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have clutches fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females mate with males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. ",0
3236,"In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. ",0
3237,"In the absence of this cost, if polyandry is advantageous, it would be expected to occur at a higher rate in lekking than among pair-bonded species.  ",1
3238,"The nest is a shallow ground scrape lined with grass leaves and stems, and concealed in marsh plants or tall grass up to 400 m (440 yd) from the lek. ",0
3239,"Nesting is solitary, although several females may lay in the general vicinity of a lek.   ",1
3240,"The eggs are slightly glossy, green or olive, and marked with dark blotches; they are laid from mid-March to early June depending on latitude.  ",1
3241,"The typical clutch is four eggs, each egg measuring 44 mm Ã 31 mm (1.7 in Ã 1.2 in) in size and weighing 21.0 g (0.74 oz) of which 5% is shell. ",0
3242,"Incubation is by the female alone, and the time to hatching is 20â23 days, with a further 25â28 days to fledging.  ",1
3243,"The precocial chicks have buff and chestnut down, streaked and barred with black, and frosted with white;  they feed themselves on a variety of small invertebrates, but are brooded by the female.  ",1
3244,One brood is raised each year.  Ruffs often show a pronounced inequality in the numbers of each sex. ,1
3245,A study of juveniles in Finland found that only 34% were males and 1% were faeders.  ,1
3246,It appears that females produce a larger proportion of males at the egg stage when they are in poor physical condition. ,0
3247,"When females are in better condition, any bias in the sex ratio is smaller or absent.  ",1
3248,"Predators of waders breeding in wet grasslands include birds such as large gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, and the impact of feral cats and stoats is unknown.    Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find.  ",1
3249,"In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome.  ",1
3250,"Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites,  but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds,  including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats,  and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems;  however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance.  ",1
3251,"The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years,  although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.  ",1
3252,"The ruff normally feeds using a steady walk and pecking action, selecting food items by sight, but it will also wade deeply and submerge its head. ",0
3253,"On saline lakes in East Africa it often swims like a phalarope, picking items off the surface.  ",1
3254,It will feed at night as well as during the day.  ,1
3255,It is thought that Ruff use both visual and auditory cues to find prey.  ,1
3256,"When feeding, the ruff frequently raises its back feathers, producing a loose pointed peak on the back; this habit is shared only by the black-tailed godwit.  ",1
3257,"During the breeding season, the ruffâs diet consists almost exclusively of the adults and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies. ",0
3258,"On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including caddis flies, water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants.  ",1
3259,Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. ,0
3260,"Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit.  ",1
3261,"On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.  ",1
3262,"Just before migration, the ruff increases its body mass at a rate of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. ",0
3263,"This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. ",0
3264,"For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.  Ruffs were formerly trapped for food in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville's enthronement banquet in 1465. ",1
3265,"The birds were netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before preparation for the table. [61if expedition is required, sugar is added, which will make them in a fortnight'stime a lump of fat: they then sell for two Shillings or half-a-crown a piece... ",1
3266,"The method of killing them is by cutting off their head with a pair of scissarssic], the quantity of blood that issues is very great, considering the size of the bird. ",0
3267,"They are dressed like the Woodcock, with their intestines; and, when killed at the critical time, say the Epicures, are reckoned the most delicious of all morsels.  ",1
3268,"The heavy toll on breeding birds, together with loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, meant that the species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963.    ",1
3269,"The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden has resulted in the ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country.  ",1
3270,The use of insecticides and draining of wetlands has led to a decrease in the number of ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s.  There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food.  [66 ,1
3271,] A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.  ,1
3272,"Although this bird eats rice on the wintering grounds, where it can make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. ",0
3273,"It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.  ",1
3274,"The ruff has a large range, estimated at 1â10 million square kilometres (0.38â3.8 million square miles) and a population of at least 2,000,000 birds. ",0
3275,"The European population of 200,000â510,000 pairs, occupying more than half of the total breeding range, seems to have declined by up to 30% over ten years, but this may reflect geographical changes in breeding populations. ",0
3276,"Numbers in Asia do not appear to be declining, and more ruffs are wintering in Africa. ",0
3277,"The species as a whole is therefore not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). ",0
3278,"The most important breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway has expanded to the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. ",0
3279,"Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline is a continuation of trend towards range contraction that has occurred over the last two centuries. ",0
3280,"The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.  Fossils from the Pleistocene suggest that this species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now.  ",1
3281,"Its sensitivity to changing climate as well as to water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change.  ",1
3282,"Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.  ",1
3283,"The ruff is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, where it is allocated to category 2c; that is, the populations in need of special attention as they are showing ""significant long-term decline"" in much of its range.  ",1
3284,"This commits signatories to regulate the taking of listed species or their eggs, to establish protected areas to conserve habitats for the listed species, to regulate hunting and to monitor the populations of the birds concerned.[72The ruff has three male forms, which differ in mating behaviour and in appearance: the typical territorial males which have a dark neck ruff, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and the very rare cryptic males known as ""faeders"" which have female-like plumage. ",0
3285,"The behaviour and appearance of each individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by a simple genetic polymorphism.  ",1
3286,"Territorial behaviour and appearance is recessive to satellite behaviour and appearance,[43while preliminary research results suggest that the faeder characteristics are genetically controlled by a single dominant gene.[73It was originally thought that the difference between territorial and satellite males was due to a sex-linked genetic factor, but in fact the genetic locus relevant for the mating strategy is located on an autosome, or non-sex chromosome. ",0
3287,"That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene, not just males. ",0
3288,"The female does not normally show evidence of her genetic type, but when females are given testosterone implants, they display the male behaviour corresponding to their genotype.  ",1
3289,"This testosterone-linked behaviour is unusual in birds, where external sexual characteristics are normally determined by the presence or absence of oestrogen.  ",1
3290,"In 2016, two studies further pinpointed the responsible region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement.   ",1
3291,"The scientists were able to show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. ",0
3292,"About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region led to the satellite allele. ",0
3293,"The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, one of them is the centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. ",0
3294,The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. ,0
3295,"Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. ",0
3296,Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. ,0
3297,"Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. ",0
3298,The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.[77 See ,0
3299,"This passerine is primarily found across the Southwestern United States and much of the interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. ",0
3300,"Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. ",0
3301,"Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. ",0
3302,This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. ,0
3303,"The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak. ",0
3304,These sparrows feed primarily on seeds in the winter and insects in the spring and summer. ,0
3305,"The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. ",0
3306,"Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. ",0
3307,"Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. ",0
3308,"Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. ",0
3309,"They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. ",0
3310,"Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct. ",0
3311,"This bird belongs to the family Passerellidae, which consists of the American sparrows. ",0
3312,"The American sparrows are seed-eating New World birds with conical bills, brown or gray plumage, and distinctive head patterns. ",0
3313,"Birds in the genus Aimophila tend to be medium-sized at 5 to 8 inches (13 to 20 cm) in length, live in arid scrubland, have long bills and tails in proportion to their body size as well as short, rounded wings, and build cup-shaped nests.   ",1
3314,The rufous-crowned sparrow was described in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps.  ,1
3315,"It has also been described as belonging to the genus Peucaea, which contains several sparrows in the genus Aimophila that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that other members of the genus do not.   ",1
3316,"However, splitting the Peucaea sparrows into a separate genus is not generally recognized.   ",1
3317,"Aimophila divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the Oaxaca sparrow and rusty sparrow, being maintained as the genus Aimophila.  ",1
3318,"In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown towhees of the genus Pipilo than the other members of the historical genus Aimophila.  ",1
3319,"The derivation of the current genus name, Aimophila, is from the Greek aimos/Î±ÌÎ1Î1⁄4Î¿Ï, meaning ""thicket"", and -philos/-ÏÎ1Î»Î¿Ï, meaning ""loving"".  ",1
3320,"The specific epithet is a literal derivation of the common name, derived from the Latin rufus, meaning ""reddish"" or ""tawny"", and -ceps, from caput, meaning ""head"".  ",1
3321,The bird is also occasionally referred to colloquially as the rock sparrow because of its preference for rocky slopes.  ,1

3327,"Its wings are short, rounded, and brown and lack wingbars, or a line of feathers of a contrasting color in the middle of the bird's wing. ",0
3328,The face and supercilium (the area above the eye) are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black streak on each cheek.  ,1

3336,"The range of this species is discontinuous and is made up of many small, isolated populations.  ",1
3337,"The rufous-crowned sparrow is a non-migratory species, though the mountain subspecies are known to descend to lower elevations during severe winters.  ",1
3338,This sparrow is found in open oak woodlands and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and bushes. ,0
3339,The species is also known from coastal scrublands and chaparral areas.  ,1
3340,The average territory size of rufous-crowned sparrows in the chaparral of California ranges from 2 acres (0.81 ha) to 4 acres (1.6 ha).  ,1
3341,"The density of territories varies by habitat, including 2.5 to 5.8 territories per 99 acres (40 ha) of three- to five-year-old burned chaparral to 3.9 to 6.9 territories for the same amount of coastal scrubland.  ",1
3342,"One pair tends to be supported by a territory, although birds without a mate have been seen sharing a territory with a mated pair.  ",1
3343,This sparrow is awkward in flight and primarily uses running and hopping to move.  ,1
3344,"The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks in late summer and early autumn. ",0
3345,During the winter they can occasionally be found in loose mixed-species foraging flocks.  ,1
3346,"Predators of adult sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and white-tailed kites.  ",1
3347,"The nests may be raided by a range of species including mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation has not yet been directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush.  ",1
3348,"The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.   ",1
3349,"In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator.  ",1
3350,The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the tumbling off the bush display.  ,1
3351,"The longest lifespan recorded for a rufous-crowned sparrow is three years, two months.  Two species of tick, Amblyomma americanum and Ixodes pacificus, are known to parasitize the sparrow.  ",1
3352,"This sparrow feeds primarily on small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter.  ",1
3353,"During these seasons, insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects as well as spiders make up a small part of its diet. ",0
3354,"In the spring and summer, the bird's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects.  ",1
3355,The rufous-crowned sparrow forages slowly on or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses.  ,1
3356,"Though it occasionally forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. ",0
3357,It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs.  ,1
3358,"During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs.  ",1
3359,"However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. ",0
3360,This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.  ,1
3361,"It is unknown whether this species obtains all of the water it needs from its food or if it must also drink; however, it has been observed both drinking and bathing in pools of water after rain storms.  ",1
3362,Males attract a mate by singing from regular positions at the edge of their territories throughout the breeding season. ,0
3363,"These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years.  ",1
3364,"If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out.  ",1
3365,"While it is not known when precisely the breeding season starts, the earliest that a sparrow has been observed carrying nesting material was on March 2 in southern California.  ",1
3366,"The female bird builds a bulky, thick-walled open-cup nest typically on the ground, though occasionally in a low bush up to 18 in (46 cm) above it, from dried grasses and rootlets, sometimes with strips of bark, small twigs, and weed stems.   ",1
3367,"Nests are well hidden, as they are built near bushes or tall grasses or overhanging rock with concealing vegetation.  ",1
3368,"Once a sparrow chooses a nesting site, it tends to return to the site for many years.  ",1
3369,"It lays between two and five eggs at a time and typically only raises one brood a year, though some birds in California have been observed raising two or even three broods a year.   ",1
3370,"In case of a nesting failure, replacement clutches may be laid.  ",1
3371,"The eggs are an unmarked, pale bluish-white.  Broods of the rufous-crowned sparrow have very occasionally been observed to be parasitized by ",1
3372,The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. ,0
3373,"Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. ",0
3374,"When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. ",0
3375,Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. ,0
3376,"Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El NinÌo years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.  ",1
3377,"The rufous-crowned sparrow is treated as a species of least concern, or not threatened with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about 463,323 sq mi (1,200,000 km2), estimated population of 2.4 million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years.  ",1
3378,"In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed and those that do produce fewer offspring.   ",1
3379,Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number.  ,1
3380,"The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct,  and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s.  Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. ",1
3381,"Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though more research is needed to determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.[11 ",0
3382,"The russet sparrow (Passer cinnamomeus), also called the cinnamon or cinnamon tree sparrow, is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. ",0
3383,", it has a body length of 14 to 15 cm (5.5â5.9 in). ",0
3384,"It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the plumage of both sexes patterned similarly to that of the corresponding sex of house sparrow. ",0
3385,"Its vocalisations are sweet and musical chirps, which when strung together form a song. ",0
3386,"Three subspecies are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness of their underparts. ",0
3387,"The subspecies rutilans and intensior breed in parts of eastern Asia, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in the Himalayas, where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation. ",0
3388,The russet sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the house and Eurasian tree sparrows are absent. ,0
3389,"In the southern part of its range, the russet sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. ",0
3390,"The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art. ",0
3391,"This sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, particularly during the breeding season. ",0
3392,"This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. ",0
3393,"While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. ",0
3394,"It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. ",0
3395,"In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. ",0
3396,"Its nest is located in a tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. ",0
3397,The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. ,0
3398,The English ornithologist John Gould described a specimen of the russet sparrow collected in the Himalayas at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London in December 1835 under the binomial name Pyrgita cinnamomea. ,0

3402,It was at one time believed that the livraison containing the description of the russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared sometime in 1836 but as the precise date is not known under the rules of the  International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ,0
3403,"The russet sparrow has usually been placed in the genus Passer, and within this genus it is seen as a part of the ""Palearctic black-bibbed sparrow"" group, which includes the Eurasian tree sparrow as well as the house sparrow. ",0
3404,"It has generally been seen as a close relation of the house sparrow, and Richard Meinertzhagen even considered it to be the same species as the Somali sparrow, one of the house sparrow's closest relatives.   ",1
3405,"However, studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate that the russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows.    ",1
3406,"While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene,  British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. ",1
3407,"During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.   ",1
3408,"Thirteen subspecies have been described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing largely in the colour of their underparts.   ",1
3409,"The subspecies Passer cinnamomea rutilans breeds in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and southeastern and central China. ",0
3410,"The subspecies intensior, described in 1922 by Walter Rothschild from Yunnan, breeds in southwest China and parts of India, Burma, Laos, and Vietnam.    ",1
3411,"In a large part of Sichuan intensior intergrades with P. c. rutilans, and a number of subspecies names have been proposed for the intergrades.  ",1
3412,"The nominate subspecies cinnamomeus, described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern Arunachal Pradesh to Nuristan in Afghanistan.   ",1
3413,"The russet sparrow is a small chunky bird, with plumage warm rufous in overall colour. ",0
3414,It is a medium-sized sparrow at 14 to 15 cm (5.5â5.9 in) and 18 to 22.5 grams (0.63â0.79 oz).   ,1
3415,"It has a thick bill suited to eating seeds, which is black on the breeding male, horn-coloured on the non-breeding male, and yellowish with a dark tip on the female.  Wingspans for males range between 6.8 to 8.2 cm (2.7â3.2 in) and those for females from 6.7 to 7.7 cm (2.6â3.0 in). ",1
3416,"Tail, bill, and tarsus lengths are 4.3 to 5.1 cm (1.7â2.0 in), 1.1 to 1.3 cm (0.43â0.51 in), and 1.6 to 1.8 cm (0.63â0.71 in), respectively.   Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, between the three subspecies, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. ",1
3417,"The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form there is a tendency for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.  ",1
3418,"The flight of all sparrows is swift,  and that of the russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of the Eurasian tree sparrow.  ",1
3419,"The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, in their plumage, and have a similar pattern to that in the corresponding sex of house sparrow.   ",1
3420,"There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. ",0
3421,"Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their cheeks and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts.[18 ",0
3422,"] Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.   ",1
3423,"Moult is poorly recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. ",0
3424,"In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the breeding season and migration.  ",1
3425,"In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds and reported that they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.    ",1
3426,"The breeding male is bright russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, with a black streaking on its mantle. ",0
3427,"It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill to the rear of the head.  ",1
3428,"The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. ",0
3429,"Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. ",0
3430,The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges.    ,1
3431,"The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male,  being paler with more orange upperparts.   ",1
3432,"The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.  ",1
3433,"The female has mostly pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. ",0
3434,"It differs from the house sparrow in its slightly darker, russet-tinged plumage. ",0
3435,"It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. ",0
3436,It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff.   ,1
3437,"The juvenile is similar to the female, though more pale and sandy. ",0
3438,"As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.   ",1
3439,"The russet sparrow's vocalisations are described by most sources as ""the sweetest and most musical"" of any sparrow.  ",1
3440,"Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, similar to that of other sparrows. ",0
3441,"This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows.  ",1
3442,"This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. ",0
3443,Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep.  ,1
3444,"Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. ",0
3445,The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes similar to those of the white wagtail. [33 ,1
3446,"A thin swee swee vocalisation not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded.   ",1
3447,The russet sparrow is found in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. ,0
3448,"It is not known whether its distribution is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists.  ",1
3449,"In the Himalayas the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan.  ",1
3450,"Here, the russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.  ",1
3451,"In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow is found in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, a small part of mainland Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. ",0
3452,"It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident.  ",1
3453,"The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China,  and northern Thailand.  ",1
3454,"In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November.  ",1
3455,"The russet sparrow appears to be abundant in most habitats across most of its very large range,  and in the some areas it is among the most common birds.    ",1
3456,"In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due to global warming, but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common.  ",1
3457,"Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.  Breeding takes place in mountains and uplands across most of the range. ",1
3458,"This preference for high altitudes is influenced by latitude: in the farthest south of its range it never breeds below 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) above mean sea level, but in the northernmost part of its range it often breeds by the sea.  ",1
3459,"In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow prefers light woodland, but it is sometimes found in towns and agricultural areas.  ",1
3460,"In HokkaidoÌ, the russet sparrow finds a greater food supply for its young in more remote forests, and has greater reproductive success.   ",1
3461,"In the Himalayas, it is strongly associated with terrace cultivation, and it probably only spread to the Himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago.  ",1
3462,"In towns where it occurs alongside the house or tree sparrow, it is found in gardens and less built up areas.  ",1
3463,"In those hill stations in India where both the house and the russet sparrow occur, the house sparrow breeds around more-built up areas and bazaars, whereas the russet sparrow is ""rather more up market at the larger houses with gardens and open spaces"".  ",1
3464,"In towns where it is the only sparrow, it is not dependent on trees, breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets.  ",1
3465,"In the winter, migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine grasslands, but are never far from shrubs or trees.  ",1
3466,"In many aspects of its behaviour, the russet sparrow is similar to the house and Eurasian tree sparrows. ",0
3467,"Like them, it feeds on the ground, but spends most of its time perching on branches.  ",1
3468,"The russet sparrow is described as shy and wary by some observers, but J. Denis Summers-Smith found it approachable in Indian hill stations.  ",1
3469,"Flocking russet sparrows feed close to the ground, moving forward as birds from the rear of a flock move to the front, in what is called ""roller feeding"".  Outside its breeding season, the russet sparrow is gregarious and forms flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds.   ",1
3470,"The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. ",0
3471,"In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.  ",1
3472,"The adult russet sparrow is mostly a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. ",0
3473,"Berries, such as those of the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available.  Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, especially caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit.   ",1
3474,"Mortality rates in the russet sparrow have not been studied, but it is known that many young birds die from Isospora infections, to which the bird has little resistance.  ",1
3475,"Other recorded parasites of the russet sparrow include Protocalliphora blowflies,   and Menacanthus chewing lice.  ",1
3476,"The russet sparrow's breeding season is short, lasting about three months. ",0
3477,"The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus has been recorded breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March.  ",1
3478,"During its breeding season, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. ",0
3479,"Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests.   ",1
3480,"The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, taking advantage of the territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation.  ",1
3481,"Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes.  ",1
3482,"In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow.  ",1
3483,"The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.  ",1
3484,"The male chooses the nest site, and uses it for his courtship display, spending much time calling nearby. ",0
3485,"When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. ",0
3486,"He then bows up and down in front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive.  ",1
3487,"Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.    Eggs are elongated ovals, with a fine texture and a slight gloss. ",1
3488,"They are whitish in overall colour with a grey tinge and brown spots, streaks, or blotches.   ",1
3489,The average size of the egg is 19.2Ã14.2 millimetres (0.75Ã0.55 in).  ,1
3490,"Eggs are similar to those of the Eurasian tree sparrow, differing in a duller colour and more narrow shape,  though they cannot be separated from those of the other sparrows with certainty.  Two clutches of four or sometimes five or six eggs are laid in a year.  ",1
3491,"In HokkaidoÌ, clutches are laid between early May and early July, with two peaks in laying around mid May and late June.  ",1
3492,"Both sexes incubate and feed the young, with the male often being more active in feeding the nestlings.  ",1
3493,"In HokkaidoÌ, nestlings hatch weighing about 2 to 5 grams (0.071 to 0.176 oz), and fledge fourteen or fifteen days after hatching, weighing 15 to 55 grams (0.53 to 1.94 oz).  ",1
3494,The common cuckoo has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of the russet sparrow.  ,1
3495,"In parts of the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. ",0
3496,"Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests.   ",1
3497,"In China, the russet sparrow has been recorded as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow.  ",1
3498,In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market.  ,1
3499,The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree sparrow. ,0
3500,Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan.  ,1
3501,"The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.[59 Passer ammodendri Severtzov, 1873Passer stolickzae Hume, 1874Passer timidus Sharpe, 1888Ammopasser ammodendri ",0

3503,"At 14â16 centimetres (5.5â6.3 in) and 25â32 grams (0.88â1.13 oz), it is among the larger sparrows. ",0
3504,"Both sexes have plumage ranging from dull grey to sandy brown, and pale brown legs. ",0
3505,"Females have less boldly coloured plumage and bills, lacking the pattern of black stripes on the male's head. ",0
3506,"The head markings of both sexes make the saxaul sparrow distinctive, and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. ",0
3507,"Vocalisations include a comparatively soft and musical chirping call, a song, and a flight call. ",0
3508,"Three subspecies are recognised, differing in the overall tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female. ",0
3509,"The subspecies ammodendri occurs in the west of the saxaul sparrow's range, while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east. ",0
3510,"This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China. ",0
3511,"A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. ",0
3512,"Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities. ",0
3513,"Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. ",0
3514,"It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while breeding and as a nestling. ",0
3515,"When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. ",0
3516,Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. ,0
3517,"They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. ",0

3521,"The saxaul sparrow's legs are pale or pinkish brown, with a tarsus length of 1.95 inches (50 mm). ",0
3522,"Its bill is 1.0â1.3 centimetres (0.39â0.51 in) long, pale grey on the juvenile, pale yellowish with a black tip on the breeding female, and black on the breeding male.  ",1
3523,"Like all other sparrows, it flies swiftly and often at height.   ",1
3524,"Distinctive markings, especially on its head, make the saxaul sparrow unlikely to be confused with any other bird.  ",1
3525,"It is dull-coloured, with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown, varying between and within subspecies.   ",1
3526,"Birds of the subspecies ammodendri are a sandy grey, while nigricans birds are similar but darker, and stoliczkae birds are warm brown or russet.[3 ",0
3527,] Birds of the subspecies stoliczkae and those from the southwest of the range of ammodendri also differ from usual ammodendri birds in their lack of streaking on the rump and upper tail coverts.   ,1
3528,"The male saxaul sparrow has bold markings, with a black stripe along the top of its head and another through its eye. ",0
3529,"It has black feathering, or a ""bib"", on its throat and upper belly.  ",1

3535,"Its median coverts are black with a white tip, while its other wing feathers are variably dark brown, cinnamon, or black, tipped buff or whitish and edged grey.  ",1
3536,"The female is similar in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. ",0
3537,"It is sandy grey or brown, with a back patterned like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. ",0
3538,"The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat.  ",1

3541,"In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. ",0
3542,"The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.  ",1
3543,"Its common call is a chirp, transcribed as cheerp cheerp, softer and more melodious than that of the house sparrow.    ",1
3544,"It gives a flight call transcribed as twerp, and a song described by Russian naturalist V. N. Shnitnikov as ""not loud, but pleasantly melodious with fairly diversified intonations"".   ",1
3545,"The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of The Birds of Asia, from a specimen collected near Kyzylorda, now in southern Kazakhstan, by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov.      ",1
3546,Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as Passer ammodendri for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists. ,0
3547,"When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection, Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London.   ",1
3548,"Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873, and some later writers preferred to attribute him, but Gould's description takes priority over Severtzov's.   ",1
3549,"The saxaul sparrow's species name refers to its desert habitat, coming from the name of the Ammodendron or sand acacia tree, which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek ",0
3550,"The English name saxaul sparrow refers to the saxaul plant, with which it is closely associated.  ",1
3551,"The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the genus Passer with the house sparrow and around twenty other species,  although a genus Ammopasser was created for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890.   ",1
3552,"The saxaul sparrow's relations within the genus Passer are unclear, although with its black throat feathering it has usually been considered part of the ""Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow"" group related to the house sparrow. ",0
3553,"J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that the Palaearctic Passer sparrows evolved about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. ",0
3554,"During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as a certain steppe region in Central Asia, where Summers-Smith suggested the saxaul sparrow evolved.  Genetic and fossil evidence suggest a much earlier origin for the Passer species, perhaps in the Miocene and Pliocene, as suggested by Luis Allende and colleagues in their 2001 phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA. ",1
3555,"This analysis also suggested that the saxaul sparrow may be an early offshoot or basal species in its genus, a relative of certain African sparrows such as the northern grey-headed sparrow. ",0
3556,"If the saxaul sparrow is related to these species, either the saxaul sparrow formerly occurred in the deserts of Africa and Arabia, or each of the groups of Passer sparrows are of African origin.   ",1
3557,"Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow occurs in six probably disjunct areas, and is divided into at least three subspecies.  ",1
3558,"The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another to the south of Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. ",0
3559,"In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi,  ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter.    ",1
3560,"The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand.  ",1
3561,This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. ,0
3562,"It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia.    ",1
3563,"In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus.    ",1
3564,"The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.   ",1
3565,"The saxaul sparrow is found in remote parts of Central Asia, where its distribution is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records.  ",1
3566,"It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). ",0
3567,"Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter.    ",1
3568,"It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.  ",1
3569,"However, it seems to have lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by overgrazing.     ",1
3570,"Little is known of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour, because of its remote range. ",0
3571,"It is shy in many areas, and spends much time hidden in foliage, but breeding birds in Mongolia were reported to be ""quite confiding"".   ",1
3572,"When not breeding, it is social, and can form flocks of up to fifty birds, sometimes associating with Eurasian tree, Spanish, and house sparrows. ",0
3573,"Towards the spring, saxaul sparrows form pairs within their flock, before dispersing in April.  Seeds, especially those of the saxaul, are most of its diet, though it also eats insects, especially while breeding, most commonly weevils, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. ",1
3574,"In a study of insects fed to nestlings in the Ili River valley, it was found that beetles are predominant, with weevils and Coccinellidae comprising 60 and 30 percent of the diet of nestlings, respectively.  ",1
3575,"Because of its desert habitat and scarcity, it is not a pest of agriculture.   ",1
3576,"Where water is not available, the saxaul sparrow may fly several times each day over long distances to drink.   ",1
3577,"The saxaul sparrow is less social than other sparrows while breeding, due to its dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks.  ",1
3578,"Isolated pairs are usual, though it sometimes breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. ",0
3579,"The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June.  ",1
3580,"Unusually for a sparrow, it has not been recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records.  Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together.  Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons.     ",1
3581,"Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed.  Nests may be quite close to the ground, especially when they are built in trees.  ",1
3582,"The saxaul sparrow's nests are untidy dome-shaped constructions, with an entrance in the side or top. ",0
3583,"They are built of grasses, roots, and other plant materials, and are lined with feathers, fur, and soft plant material.    ",1
3584,"The nest is mainly built by the female, though the male may actively take part in building.   ",1
3585,"Typical clutches have five or six eggs, and two clutches a year are normal.  ",1
3586,"They are glossy, coloured white and shaded with rusty grey or yellowish brown.    ",1
3587,"In some clutches, one egg is noticeably paler than the others. ",0
3588,Four eggs collected by Zarudny from Transcaspia had an average size of 1.9 cm Ã 1.4 cm (0.75 in Ã 0.55 in).  ,1
3589,"Females play the main part in incubating eggs, and males can often be seen guarding the nests during incubation. ",0
3590,"Males and females share in feeding their young, which they do every 4 to 12 minutes.   ",1
3591,"Young that have left their nest remain nearby until well after their moult, before departing for winter flocks, followed later by the adults.[36 ",0
3592,The scarlet myzomela or scarlet honeyeater (Myzomela sanguinolenta) is a small passerine bird of the honeyeater family Meliphagidae native to Australia. ,0
3593,"At 9 to 11 centimetres (3.5 to 4.3 in) long, it is the smallest honeyeater in Australia. ",0
3594,"It is sexually dimorphic; the male is a striking bright red with black wings, while the female is entirely brown. ",0
3595,"It is more vocal than most honeyeaters, and a variety of calls have been recorded, including a bell-like tinkling. ",0
3596,"The scarlet myzomela is found along most of the eastern coastline, from Cape York in the far north to Gippsland in Victoria. ",0
3597,"It is migratory in the southern parts of its range, with populations moving north in the winter. ",0
3598,"Its natural habitat is forest, where it forages mainly in the upper tree canopy. ",0
3599,Up to three broods may be raised over the course of a breeding season. ,0
3600,The female lays two or rarely three flecked white eggs in a 5 centimetres (2 in) diameter cup-shaped nest high in a tree. ,0
3601,The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population. ,0
3602,"The scarlet myzomela was depicted in three paintings in a set of early illustrations known as the Watling drawings, done in the first years of European settlement of Sydney between 1788 and 1794. ",0
3603,"Based on these, English ornithologist John Latham described it as three separate species in 1801. ",0
3604,"He based the description of Certhia sanguinolenta on an immature male moulting into adult plumage with incomplete red colouration,   calling it the sanguineous creeper. ",1
3605,"In the same publication he described Certhia dibapha, the cochineal creeper, and C. erythropygia, the red-rumped creeper.  ",1
3606,English naturalist James Francis Stephens called it Meliphaga sanguinea in 1826 as a replacement name for Latham's Certhia sanguinolenta.   ,1
3607,"John Gould determined Latham's three names to be the one species in 1843,  adopting the first-written binomial name as the valid one and relegating the others to synonymy,   though the name Myzomela dibapha was occasionally used,  particularly in New Caledonia.  ",1
3608,"In 1990, Ian McAllan proposed that the first drawing did not confirm the species identity and proposed the name Myzomela dibapha to hence be the oldest validly published name;  however, Richard Schodde countered in 1992 that the drawing of an immature male could not be of any other species, meaning that M. sanguinolenta should stand. ",1
3609,He added that the alternative proposed name had not been in use since the 1850s.  ,1
3610,"The Wakolo myzomela, Sulawesi myzomela, Banda myzomela, and New Caledonian myzomela were all previously considered to be conspecific with the scarlet myzomela.  ",1
3611,There are no recognized subspecies nor regional variations; differences in observed plumage are due to wear after moulting.  ,1
3612,"This species is commonly known as the scarlet honeyeater in Australia and scarlet myzomela elsewhere,  ",1
3613,"Gould used Latham's name of sanguineous honeyeater in the 19th century,  which persisted into the early 20th century.  ",1
3614,Other common names are soldier-bird (as the male appears to wear a red coat) and blood-bird.  ,1
3615,"A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found the scarlet myzomela to be most closely related to the cardinal myzomela, with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that led to the red-headed myzomela, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed.  ",1
3616,"A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the scarlet myzomela diverged from that of the Banda myzomela around 2 million years ago, but the relationships of many species within the genus are uncertain.  ",1
3617,"Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea.  ",1
3618,"The smallest honeyeater native to Australia,  the scarlet myzomela is a distinctive bird with a compact body, short tail and relatively long down-curved black bill and dark brown iris. ",1
3619,"It is between 9 and 11 centimetres (3.5 and 4.3 in) long, with an average wingspan of 18 centimetres (7.1 in) and a weight of 8 grams (0.28 oz).  ",1
3620,"It has relatively long wings for its size; when the wings are folded, the longest primary feathers reach over half the length of the tail.  ",1
3621,"It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the male much more brightly coloured than the female.  ",1
3622,"The adult male has a bright red (scarlet) head, nape and upper breast, with a narrow black stripe from beak to eye and a thin black eye-ring. ",0
3623,The red plumage extends as a central stripe down the back and rump. ,0
3624,"On its breast, the red becomes more mottled with grey towards the belly and flanks, which are grey-white.  ",1
3625,"The mantle and scapulars are black and the upperwing a dull black, with white edges to the secondary covert feathers. ",0
3626,The underwing is white with a dark grey trailing edge and tip.  ,1
3627,"The female has a brown head and neck, darker on top and lighter and greyer on the sides, with a pale grey-brown throat and chin. ",0
3628,"It sometimes has pinkish or reddish patches on the forehead, throat and cheeks. ",0
3629,"The upperparts are brown, sometimes with scarlet patches on the uppertail coverts. ",0
3630,The tail is blackish-brown with yellow fringes to all but the central pair of rectrices. ,0
3631,The female has a yellowish or brownish base to its black bill. ,0
3632,"Young birds have juvenile plumage when they leave the nest;  they are similar to females though with more reddish-brown upperparts, light brown rumps and uppertail coverts.  ",1
3633,"Immature males, after moulting from juvenile plumage, have patches of red feathers coming through the juvenile brown plumage.  ",1
3634,Immature females are very difficult to distinguish from juveniles or adult females.  ,1
3635,It is unknown whether its plumage changes with moults after the scarlet myzomela attains adulthood.  ,1
3636,"The scarlet myzomela is more commonly heard than seen, and has a wider repertoire of notes in its calls than most honeyeaters. ",0
3637,The main call is a tuneful tinkling call made up of sets of six notes that rise or fall in tone. ,0
3638,"The female chirps as it hops around and upon meeting and playing with the male, and it can also make a squeaking call. ",0
3639,"] Males could be mistaken for the similar looking red-headed myzomela in eastern Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland where their ranges overlap, though the latter's red colouration is restricted to the head and is sharply demarcated. ",0
3640,"The dusky myzomela resembles the female scarlet myzomela, but is larger with a longer bill and tail, has much darker brown plumage, and lacks the pink tinge to the face and throat.  ",1
3641,"The scarlet myzomela is found from Cooktown in Far North Queensland down the east coast to Mitchell River National Park in Gippsland, Victoria. ",0
3642,It is rarer south of the Hacking River in New South Wales. ,0
3643,"Its range extends inland to Charters Towers, Carnarvon Gorge and Inglewood in Queensland, and the Warrumbungles in New South Wales. ",0
3644,"The species' movements are not well known, but it appears to be migratory in the southern part of its range and more sedentary in the north.  ",1
3645,Populations of scarlet myzomelas move northwards up a portion of the Australian east coast for winter.  ,1
3646,"Nomadic movements of populations, generally following the flowering of preferred food plants, also occur. ",0
3647,"Population numbers have been reported as fluctuating in some areas, with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred food plants.  ",1
3648,"Local irruptions have occurred in Sydney in 1902 (during a drought), 1981, 1991 (both in northwestern Sydney), and 1994 (centred on Lane Cove River valley), in Nowra in 1980, across southern Victoria in 1985, and in the Eurobodalla district in 1991 and 1993.  ",1
3649,"A field study in Mangerton over 18 years found that scarlet myzomelas arrived in the area in early Spring (August) and left by November, though they were entirely absent in three separate years.  ",1
3650,"The maximum age recorded from banding has been just over 10 years, in a bird caught south of Mount Cotton in Queensland.  ",1
3651,"Its habitat is dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, generally with eucalypts as the dominant trees and where there is little understory. ",0
3652,"Scarlet myzomelas are encountered alone, in pairs, or in small troops, sometimes with other honeyeaters in the canopy of trees in flower.  ",1
3653,"The scarlet myzomela is territorial, with males advertising their territories by singing from the tops of trees. ",0
3654,"They compete with members of the same species, and are usually driven away from some feeding areas by hungry larger honeyeaters, such as Lewin's, New Holland, white-naped, and brown honeyeaters, as well as eastern spinebills and noisy friarbirds.  ",1
3655,"In particular, breeding New Holland honeyeaters actively drive off scarlet myzomelas.  ",1
3656,"The species breeds from winter through to summer, generally beginning around July or August and winding up in January. ",0
3657,There have been odd records of nesting in April or May.  ,1
3658,"Nest failures may lead to a third brood, with females able to lay eggs around three weeks after the previous young have fledged.  ",1
3659,"The nest consists of a tiny cup of shredded bark with spider web as binding, high up in the tree canopy, or even in mistletoe.  Trees with dense foliage, such as lillypilly (Syzygium smithii), Pittosporum species, turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), mangroves, species of paperbark, eucalypts or wattles ",1
3660,"The nest is around 5 cm (2.0 in) in diameter, and takes around 8 days to build before eggs are laid in it.  Both sexes build the nest, though some observations have the male doing the bulk of construction and others the female. ",1
3661,"Alfred J. North observed that the females alone collected nesting material, such as spiderwebs and bark, tearing bark off such trees as the rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda).  The clutch size is mostly two but occasionally three eggs. ",1
3662,"Measuring 16 mm (0.63 in) long and 12.1 mm (0.48 in) wide,  the small eggs are white with the larger end flecked with dull red-brown or grey ",1
3663,"] Eggs are laid a day apart, and the female is thought to incubate the eggs al one.  ",1
3664,"The young are born naked, but are soon covered in down. ",0
3665,"The scarlet myzomela is arboreal, foraging in the crowns of trees, darting from flower to flower, probing for nectar with its long curved bill. ",0
3666,"Trees visited include turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), paperbarks (Melaleuca spp.), and banksias.  ",1
3667,"The scarlet myzomela is omnivorous, and also feeds on insects as well as nectar, sallying for flying insects in the canopy.  Insects eaten include beetles, flies, bugs, and caterpillars.  ",1
3668,"The scarlet myzomela is listed as being a species of least concern by the IUCN, on account of its large range (1,960,000 square km) and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline.  ",1
3669,"Scarlet myzomelas are rarely seen in aviculture, though they have been kept by enthusiasts in Sydney. ",0
3670,"As all honeyeaters are territorial, they tend to be aggressive in mixed-species aviaries.  ",1
3671,"Various state regulations govern the keeping of the species; in South Australia, for instance, a Specialist Licence is required, while in New South Wales a Class B2 (Advanced Bird) licence is required. ",0
3672,"Applicants for the New South Wales B2 licence must have at least 2 years' experience keeping birds, and be able to demonstrate that they can provide the appropriate care and housing for the species they wish to obtain.[35Seabirds ",0
3673,(also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. ,0
3674,"While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. ",0
3675,"The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene, In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. ",0
3676,"Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. ",0
3677,"Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. ",0
3678,"They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. ",0
3679,"Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely ",0
3680,", Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. ",0
3681,"Many species are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation efforts are under way, There exists no single definition of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions are in some way arbitrary. ",0
3682,"In the words of two seabird scientists, ""The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in saltwater; but, as seems to be true with any statement in biology, some do not. ",0
3683,"However, by convention all of the Sphenisciformes and Procellariiformes, all of the Pelecaniformes except the darters, and some of the Charadriiformes (the skuas, gulls, terns, auks and skimmers) are classified as seabirds. ",0
3684,"The phalaropes are usually included as well, since although they are waders (""shorebirds"" in North America), two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically. ",0
3685,"Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, are usually categorized as water birds, not seabirds. ",0
3686,"Although there are a number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. ",0
3687,"Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds. ",0
3688,"Sea eagles and other fish-eating birds of prey are also typically excluded, however tied to marine environments they may be. ",0
3689,"Seabirds, by virtue of living in a geologically depositional environment (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record.  ",1
3690,"They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater)  but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.  Flying Cretaceous seabirds do not exceed wingspans of two meters; any sizes were taken by piscivorous pterosaurs.  ",1
3691,"While Hesperornis is not thought to have left descendants, the earliest modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes. ",0
3692,"In the Paleogene both pterosaurs and marine reptiles became extinct, allowing seabirds to expand ecologically. ",0
3693,"These post-extinction seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins).  ",1
3694,"Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might date back to the Oligocene.  ",1
3695,The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. ,0
3696,"At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.  ",1
3697,Seabirds have made numerous adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. ,0
3698,"Wing morphology has been shaped by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. ",0
3699,"Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings.  ",1
3700,"Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring.  ",1
3701,"Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. ",0
3702,"The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having a strong sense of smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean,  and possibly to locate their colonies. ",1
3703,"Salt glands are used by seabirds to deal with the salt they ingest by drinking and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate.  ",1
3704,"The excretions from these glands (which are positioned in the head of the birds, emerging from the nasal cavity) are almost pure sodium chloride. ",0
3705,"With the exception of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. ",0
3706,"However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. ",0
3707,"This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. ",0
3708,The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water.  ,1
3709,"This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water. ",0
3710,"The plumage of most seabirds is less colourful than that of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey.  ",1
3711,"A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), but most of the colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. ",0
3712,"The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is the same as that of Antarctic prions,  and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below). ",1
3713,"The usually black wing tips help prevent wear, as they contain melanins to make them black that helps the feathers resist abrasion.  ",1
3714,"Seabirds evolved to exploit different food resources in the world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. ",0
3715,"These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. ",0
3716,"There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme. ",0
3717,"Many seabirds feed on the ocean's surface, as the action of marine currents often concentrates food such as krill, forage fish, squid or other prey items within reach of a dipped head. ",0
3718,"Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches, surface feeding while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds and storm petrels), and surface feeding while swimming (examples of which are practiced by fulmars, gulls, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels). ",0
3719,"Surface feeders in flight include some of the most acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigate-birds and some terns), or ""walk"", pattering and hovering on the water's surface, as some of the storm-petrels do.  ",1
3720,"Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so.  ",1
3721,"Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer, which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the waterâthis shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. ",0
3722,"The skimmer's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one. ",0
3723,"Surface feeders that swim often have unique bills as well, adapted for their specific prey. ",0
3724,"Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae to filter out plankton from mouthfuls of water,  and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. ",1
3725,Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle. ,0
3726,"Pursuit diving exerts greater pressures (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but the reward is a greater area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. ",0
3727,"Underwater propulsion is provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, diving petrels and some other species of petrel) or feet (as used by cormorants, grebes, loons and several types of fish-eating ducks). ",0
3728,"The use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), penguins cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of diving. ",0
3729,"For example, the razorbill (an Atlantic auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size.  ",1
3730,"Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding procellariids, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. ",0
3731,"The short-tailed shearwater is the deepest diver of the shearwaters, having been recorded diving below 70 m.  ",1
3732,"Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with light-mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at 12 m.  ",1
3733,"Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses, and they are also the poorest divers. ",0
3734,"This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, but it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. ",0
3735,"With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds, especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding. ",0
3736,"Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns and brown pelicans all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving into the water from flight. ",0
3737,"Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from the momentum of the dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage),  and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. ",1
3738,"In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. ",0
3739,"In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully developâonce mature, they can dive from 20 m (70 ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury.  ",1
3740,"It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air,  and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive.  ",1
3741,Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.  ,1
3742,This catch-all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. ,0
3743,Kleptoparasites are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. ,0
3744,"Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically.  ",1
3745,"The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy.  Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting.  ",1
3746,"A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.  ",1
3747,"Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. ",0
3748,"Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses.  ",1
3749,"Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.  ",1
3750,Seabirds' life histories are dramatically different from those of land birds. ,0
3751,"In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more effort into fewer young.   Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet),  and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.  Care of young is protracted, extending for as long as six months, among the longest for birds. ",1
3752,"For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea.  ",1
3753,"The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill,  with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months.  ",1
3754,"Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. ",0
3755,"This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.  ",1
3756,"Because of the greater investment in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. ",0
3757,"Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life.  Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance that is part of pair-bond formation.[34 ",1
3758,"] Ninety-five percent of seabirds are colonial,  and seabird colonies are among the largest bird colonies in the world, providing one of Earth's great wildlife spectacles. ",1
3759,"Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the tropics (such as Kiritimati in the Pacific) and in the polar latitudes (as in Antarctica). ",0
3760,Seabird colonies occur exclusively for the purpose of breeding; non-breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated. ,0
3761,"Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an albatross colony, or densely packed as with a murre colony. ",0
3762,"In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. ",0
3763,"Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. ",0
3764,"Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces.  ",1
3765,The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. ,0
3766,"When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels in order to use their burrows.  ",1
3767,"Many seabirds show remarkable site fidelity, returning to the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour.  ",1
3768,"This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site.  ",1
3769,"Young adults breeding for the first time usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. ",0
3770,"This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m;  another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.  ",1
3771,"Colonies are usually situated on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing.  ",1
3772,"This is thought to provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. ",0
3773,"Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); this may be a reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds.  ",1
3774,"There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. ",0
3775,"There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. ",0
3776,"Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.  Birds from different colonies often forage in different areas to avoid competition.  ",1
3777,"Of these, the trip taken by the Arctic tern is the farthest of any bird, crossing the equator in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica. ",0
3778,"Other species also undertake trans-equatorial trips, both from the north to the south, and from south to north. ",0
3779,"The population of elegant terns, which nest off Baja California, splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the Central Coast of California and some travelling as far south as Peru and Chile to feed in the Humboldt Current.  ",1
3780,"The sooty shearwater undertakes an annual migration cycle that rivals that of the Arctic tern; birds that nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 kilometres (40,000 mi).  ",1
3781,"Other species also migrate shorter distances away from the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. ",0
3782,"If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if the bird is young.  ",1
3783,"After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species' normal range. ",0
3784,"Some species, such as the auks, do not have a concerted migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches.  Other species, such as some of the storm petrels, diving petrels and cormorants, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round. ",1
3785,"While the definition of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend their lives on the ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. ",0
3786,"Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. ",0
3787,"Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found 480 kilometres (300 mi) inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites.  ",1
3788,"The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on.  Other species, such as the California gull, nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter.  ",1
3789,"Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. ",0
3790,In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors.  ,1
3791,"Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well. ",0
3792,"The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, are more restricted in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. ",0
3793,"This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but can happen in great numbers to exhausted adults after large storms, an event known as a wreck,  where they provide prized sightings for birders. ",1
3794,"Seabirds have had a long association with both fisheries and sailors, and both have drawn benefits and disadvantages from the relationship. ",0
3795,"Fishermen have traditionally used seabirds as indicators of both fish shoals,  underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. ",1
3796,"In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific.  ",1
3797,"Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. ",0
3798,"Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas. ",0
3799,"Negative effects on fisheries are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture,  although long-lining fisheries also have to deal with bait stealing. ",1
3800,"There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there is some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).  ",1
3801,"Some seabird species have benefited from fisheries, particularly from discarded fish and offal. ",0
3802,"These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations.  ",1
3803,"This can have other impacts; for example, the spread of the northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards.  ",1
3804,"Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins. ",0
3805,"Fisheries also have negative effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, are a source of increasing concern to conservationists. ",0
3806,"The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries.   ",1
3807,"Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). ",0
3808,"The hunting of seabirds and the collecting of seabird eggs have contributed to the declines of many species, and the extinction of several, including the great auk and the spectacled cormorant. ",0
3809,"Seabirds have been hunted for food by coastal peoples throughout historyâone of the earliest instances known is in southern Chile, where archaeological excavations in middens has shown hunting of albatrosses, cormorants and shearwaters from 5000 BP.  ",1
3810,"This pressure has led to some species becoming extinct in many places; in particular, at least 20 species of an original 29 no longer breed on Easter Island. ",0
3811,"In the 19th century, the hunting of seabirds for fat deposits and feathers for the millinery trade reached industrial levels. ",0
3812,"Muttonbirding (harvesting shearwater chicks) developed as important industries in both New Zealand and Tasmania, and the name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its seemingly miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers.  ",1
3813,"In the Falkland Islands, hundreds of thousands of penguins were harvested for their oil each year. ",0
3814,"Seabird eggs have also long been an important source of food for sailors undertaking long sea voyages, as well as being taken when settlements grow in areas near a colony. ",0
3815,"Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid-19th century, a period in the islands' history from which the seabird species are still recovering.  ",1
3816,"Both hunting and egging continue today, although not at the levels that occurred in the past, and generally in a more controlled manner. ",0
3817,"For example, the MaÌori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional stewardship, kaitiakitanga, to manage the harvest, but now also work with the University of Otago in studying the populations.  ",1
3818,"In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.  ",1
3819,Other human factors have led to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations and species. ,0
3820,"Seabirds, breeding predominantly on small isolated islands, are vulnerable to predators because they have lost many behaviours associated with defence from predators.  ",1
3821,"Feral cats can take seabirds as large as albatrosses, and many introduced rodents, such as the Pacific rat, take eggs hidden in burrows. ",0
3822,"Introduced goats, cattle, rabbits and other herbivores can create problems, particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young.  ",1
3823,"The disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as wellâvisitors, even well-meaning tourists, can flush brooding adults off a colony, leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators. ",0
3824,The build-up of toxins and pollutants in seabirds is also a concern. ,0
3825,"Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of the insecticide DDT until it was banned; DDT was implicated, for example, in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California.  ",1
3826,"Oil spills are also a threat to seabirds: the oil is toxic, and bird feathers become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing.  Oil pollution in particular threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations. ",1
3827,The threats faced by seabirds have not gone unnoticed by scientists or the conservation movement. ,0
3828,"As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced of the need to declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans),  and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. ",1
3829,"Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia. ",0
3830,"Island restoration techniques, pioneered by New Zealand, enable the removal of exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. ",0
3831,"Feral cats have been removed from Ascension Island, Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands,  and rats from Campbell Island. ",1
3832,The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. ,0
3833,"After the removal of cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began to nest there again for the first time in over a hundred years.  ",1
3834,"Seabird mortality caused by long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and by using bird scarers,  and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. ",1
3835,The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife. ,0
3836,"One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, near the important bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra and the surrounding islands. ",0
3837,"The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. ",0
3838,"The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face and how we can protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. ",0
3839,Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. ,0
3840,"For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.  ",1
3841,"The plight of albatross and large seabirds, as well as other marine creatures, being taken as bycatch by long-line fisheries, has been addressed by a large number of non-governmental organizations (including BirdLife International, the American Bird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). ",0
3842,"This led to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding treaty designed to protect these threatened species, which has been ratified by eleven countries as of 2008 (namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom).  ",1
3843,Many seabirds are little studied and poorly known because they live far out at sea and breed in isolated colonies. ,0
3844,"Some seabirds, particularly the albatrosses and gulls, are more well-known to humans. ",0
3845,"The albatross has been described as ""the most legendary of birds"",  and have a variety of myths and legends associated with them. ",1
3846,"While it is widely considered unlucky to harm them, the notion that sailors believed that is a myth  that derives from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem, ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"", in which a sailor is punished for killing an albatross by having to wear its corpse around his neck. ",1
3847,"Sailors did, however, consider it unlucky to touch a storm petrel, especially one that landed on the ship.  ",1
3848,Gulls are one of the most commonly seen seabirds because they frequent human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and often show a fearless nature. ,0
3849,"Gulls have been used as metaphors, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea; in The Lord of the Rings, they appear in the insignia of Gondor and therefore NuÌmenor (used in the design of the films), and they call Legolas to (and across) the sea. ",0
3850,Pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.  ,1
3851,The following are the groups of birds normally classed as seabirds. ,0
3852,"(Tubenoses: pan-oceanic and pelagic; 93 species) Pelecaniformes (Worldwide; 8 species) Suliformes (Worldwide; about 56 species) Phaethontiformes (Worldwide tropical seas; 3 species) Charadriiformes (Worldwide; 305 species, but only the families listed are classed as seabirds.) For an alternative taxonomy of these groups, see also Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. ",0
3853,"The secretarybird or secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) is a large, mostly terrestrial bird of prey. ",0
3854,"Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savanna of the sub-Saharan region. ",0
3855,"Although a member of the order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal birds of prey such as kites, hawks, vultures, and harriers, it is placed in its own family, Sagittariidae. ",0
3856,The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on crane-like legs that give the bird a height of as much as 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in). ,0
3857,"Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black flight feathers and thighs. ",0
3858,"Breeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. ",0
3859,"The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. ",0
3860,In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. ,0
3861,"The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. ",0
3862,"Although the secretarybird occurs over a large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. ",0
3863,The species is therefore classed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ,0
3864,The secretarybird appears on the coats of arms of Sudan and South Africa. ,0
3865,Cathartidae â New World vultures (7 species) Sagittariidae â Secretarybird Pandionidae â ,0
3866,"Ospreys (2 species) Accipitridae â Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species) The Dutch naturalist Arnout Vosmaer described the secretarybird in 1769 on the basis of a live specimen that had been sent to Holland from the Cape of Good Hope two years earlier by an official of the Dutch East India Company. ",0
3867,"Vosmaer suggested that the species was called ""sagittarius"" by the Dutch settlers because its gait was thought to resemble an archer's. ",0
3868,"He also mentioned that it was known as the ""secretarius"" by farmers who had domesticated the bird to combat pests around their homesteads, and proposed that the word ""secretarius"" might be a corruption of ""sagittarius"".   ",1
3869,"Ian Glenn of the University of the Free State suggests that Vosmaer's ""sagittarius"" is a misheard or mis-transcribed form of ""secretarius"", rather than the other way around.  ",1
3870,In 1779 the English illustrator John Frederick Miller included a coloured plate of the secretarybird in his Icones animalium et plantarum and coined the binomial name Falco serpentarius.  ,1
3871,"As the oldest published specific name, serpentarius has priority over later scientific names.  ",1
3872,The species was assigned to its own genus Sagittarius in 1783 by the French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula affinitatum animalium.  ,1
3873,"The generic name Sagittarius is Latin for ""archer"", and the specific epithet serpentarius is from Latin serpens meaning ""serpent"" or ""snake"".  ",1
3874,"A second edition of Miller's plates was published in 1796 as Cimelia physica, with added text by English naturalist George Shaw, who named it Vultur serpentarius.  ",1
3875,"The French naturalist Georges Cuvier erected the genus Serpentarius in 1798,  and the German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger erected the (now synonymous ) genus Gypogeranus from the Ancient Greek words gyps ""vulture"" and geranos ""crane"" in 1811.  ",1
3876,"In 1835 the Irish naturalist William Ogilby spoke at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London and proposed three species of secretarybird, distinguishing those from Senegambia as having broader crest feathers than those from South Africa, and reporting a distinct species from the Philippines based on the writings of Pierre Sonnerat in his Voyage aÌ la Nouvelle-GuineÌe.  ",1
3877,"Despite its large range, the secretarybird is considered monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.  ",1
3878,The evolutionary relationship of the secretarybird to other raptors had long puzzled ornithologists. ,0
3879,The species was usually placed in its own family Sagittariidae within the order Falconiformes.  ,1
3880,"A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 found that the secretarybird was sister to a clade containing the ospreys in the family Pandionidae and the kites, hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae. ",0
3881,The same study found that the falcons in the order Falconiformes were only distantly related to the other diurnal birds of prey. ,0
3882,"The families Cathartidae, Sagittariidae, Pandionidae and Accipitridae were therefore moved from Falconiformes to the resurrected Accipitriformes.   ",1
3883,A later molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 confirmed these relationships.  ,1
3884,The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. ,0
3885,"The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were discovered in France. ",0
3886,The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. ,0
3887,"In spite of their age, the two species are not thought to be ancestral to the secretarybird.   ",1
3888,"Though strongly convergent with the modern secretarybird, the extinct raptor Apatosagittarius is thought to be an accipitrid.  ",1
3889,"The International Ornithologists' Union has designated ""secretarybird"" the official common name for the species.  ",1
3890,"In 1780 the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that the name secretary/secreÌtaire had been chosen because of the long quill-like feathers at the top of the bird's neck,  reminiscent of a quill pen behind the ear of an ancient scribe.  ",1
3891,"In 1977, C. Hilary Fry of Aberdeen University suggested that ""secretary"" is from the French secreÌtaire, a corruption of the Arabic saqr-et-tair meaning either ""hawk of the semi-desert"" or ""hawk that flies"".  ",1
3892,"Glenn has dismissed this etymology on the grounds that there is no evidence that the name came through French, instead supporting Buffon's etymology; namely, that the word comes from the Dutch secretaris ""secretary"", used by settlers in South Africa.  ",1
3893,The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large terrestrial bird with an eagle-like head and body on crane-like legs. ,0
3894,It has a length of between 112 and 150 cm (44 and 59 in) and a wingspan of between 191 and 215 cm (75 and 85 in).  ,1
3895,"The weight ranges from 3.74 to 4.27 kg (8.2 to 9.4 lb), with a mean of 4.05 kg (8.9 lb).  ",1
3896,The tarsus averages 31 cm (12 in) and the tail is 57â85 cm (22â33 in): both factor into making it both taller and longer than any other species of raptor.  ,1
3897,"The neck is not especially long, and can only be lowered down to the intertarsal joint, so birds must stoop to reach down to the ground.  ",1
3898,"During flight, two elongated central feathers of the tail extend beyond the feet, and the neck stretches out like a stork.  ",1
3899,"The plumage of the crown, upperparts, and lesser and median wing coverts is blue-grey, and the underparts and underwing coverts are lighter grey to grey-white. ",0
3900,The crest is made up of long black feathers arising from the nape. ,0
3901,"The scapulars, primary and secondary flight feathers, rump and thighs are black, while the uppertail coverts are white, though barred with black in some individuals.  ",1
3902,"The tail is wedge-shaped with white tipping, marbled grey and black colouring at the base, and two broad black bands, one at the base and the other at the end.   ",1
3903,"Sexes resemble one another, although the male tends to have longer tail feathers, more head plumes, a shorter head and more blue-grey plumage. ",0
3904,Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow cere. ,0
3905,"The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. ",0
3906,"The toes are shortâaround 20% of the length of those of an eagle of the same sizeâand stout, so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. ",0
3907,The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at the base by a small web.  ,1
3908,"Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail feathers and greyish rather than brown irises.[24 ",0
3909,] Adults are normally silent but can utter a deep guttural croaking noise in nuptial displays or at nests.  ,1
3910,"Secretarybirds make this sound when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. ",0
3911,Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls.[27 ,0
3912,"] Chicks make a sharp sound heard as ""chee-uk-chee-uk-chee-uk"" for their first 30 days.  ",1
3913,"The secretarybird is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and is generally non-migratory, though it may be locally nomadic as it follows rainfall and the resulting abundance of prey.  ",1
3914,"Its range extends from Senegal to Somalia and south to Cape Province, South Africa.  ",1
3915,"The species is also found at a variety of elevations, from the coastal plains to the highlands. ",0
3916,"The secretarybird prefers open grasslands, savannas and shrubland (Karoo) rather than forests and dense shrubbery that may impede its cursorial existence.  ",1
3917,"More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) high and avoids those with grass over 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high. ",0
3918,"It is rarer in grasslands in northern parts of its range that otherwise appear similar to areas in southern Africa where it is abundant, suggesting it may avoid hotter regions. ",0
3919,Secretarybirds are not generally gregarious aside from pairs and their offspring. ,0
3920,"They usually roost in trees of the genus Acacia or Balanites, or even introduced pine trees in South Africa.  ",1
3921,"They set off 1â2 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time preening.  Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remaining in sight of one another. ",1
3922,"They pace around at a speed of 2.5â3 km/h (1.6â1.9 mph), taking 120 steps per minute on average.  ",1
3923,"After spending much of the day on the ground, secretarybirds return at dusk,  moving downwind before flying in upwind.  ",1
3924,"Birds encountered singly are often unattached males, their territories generally in less suitable areas. ",0
3925,"Conversely, larger groups of up to 50 individuals may be present at an area with a localised resource such as a waterhole in a dry area or an irruption of rodents or locusts fleeing a fire.  ",1
3926,"Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner and requiring uplift to be sustained; otherwise they may become exhausted. ",0
3927,"In the heat of the day, they use thermals to rise up to 3,800 m (12,500 ft) above the ground.  ",1
3928,"The lifespan is thought to be 10 to 15 years in the wild,  with the oldest confirmed by banding to be 5 years from a nestling banded on 23 July 2011 in Bloemfontein and recovered 440 km (270 mi) away in Mpumalanga on 7 June 2016,  and up to 19 years in captivity.  ",1
3929,Secretarybirds form monogamous pairs and defend a large territory of around 50 km2 (19 sq mi). ,0
3930,"They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. ",0
3931,"During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. ",0
3932,"Males and females can also perform a ground display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, which is also the way they defend their territory. ",0
3933,"The nest is built by both sexes at the top of a dense thorny tree, often an Acacia, at a height of between 2.5 and 13 m (8 and 40 ft) above the ground. ",0
3934,The nest is constructed as a relatively flat platform of sticks 1.0â1.5 m (3â5 ft) across with a depth 30â50 cm (12â20 in). ,0
3935,The shallow depression is lined with grass and the occasional piece of dung.  Eggs are laid at 2- to 3-day intervals until the clutch of 1â3 eggs is complete. ,1
3936,The elongated chalky bluish green or white eggs average 78 mm Ã 57 mm (3.1 in Ã 2.2 in) and weigh 130 g (4.6 oz).  ,1
3937,"Both parents incubate the eggs, starting as soon as the first egg is laid, but it is usually the female that remains on the nest overnight. ",0
3938,The incubating parent greets its partner when it returns with a display of bowing and bobbing its head with neck extended. ,0
3939,"The tail is held upright with feathers fanned out, and the chest feathers are puffed out.  ",1
3940,The eggs hatch after around 45 days at intervals of 2â3 days.  ,1
3941,The adults regurgitate food onto the floor of the nest and then pick up items and pass them to the chicks.  ,1
3942,For the first 2 or 3 weeks after the eggs hatch the parents take turns to stay at the nest with the young.  ,1
3943,"Despite the difference in nestling size due to the asynchronous hatching, little sibling aggression has been observed.  ",1
3944,"Under favourable conditions all chicks from a clutch of three eggs fledge,  but if food is scarce one or more of the chicks will die from starvation.  ",1
3945,"The young may be preyed upon by crows, ravens, hornbills, and large owls.  ",1
3946,The young are born covered in grey-white down that becomes darker grey after two weeks. ,0
3947,"Crest feathers appear at 21 days, and flight feathers by 28 days. ",0
3948,"They can stand up and feed autonomously after 40 days, although the parents still feed the nestlings after that time. ",0
3949,"At 60 days, the now fully-feathered young start to flap their wings. ",0
3950,"Their weight gain over this period changes from 56 g (2.0 oz) at hatching, to 500 g (18 oz) at 20 days, 1.1 kg (2.4 lb) at 30 days, 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) at 40 days, 2 kg (4.4 lb) at 50 days, 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) at 60 days, and 3 kg (6.6 lb) at 70 days. ",0
3951,"The time they leave the nest can be anywhere between 65 and 106 days of age, although it most typically occurs between 75 and 80 days of age. ",0
3952,Fledging is accomplished by jumping out of the nest or using a semi-controlled glide to the ground.  ,1
3953,Juveniles remain in their natal range before dispersing when they are between 4 and 7 months of age. ,0
3954,"The usual age at which they first breed is uncertain but there is a record of a male bird breeding successfully at an age of 2 years and 9 months, which is young for a large raptor.  ",1
3955,"Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot. ",0
3956,"Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides.  ",1
3957,"Prey may consist of insects such as locusts and beetles,  mammals ranging in size from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, small birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or bush fires. ",1
3958,"Larger herbivores are not generally hunted, although there are some reports of secretarybirds killing young gazelles  and cheetah cubs.  ",1
3959,"The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important and venomous species such as adders and cobras are regularly among the types of snake preyed upon. ",0
3960,The birds often flush prey from tall grass by stomping on the surrounding vegetation. ,0
3961,"Their crest feathers may raise during a hunt, which may serve to help scare the target and provide shade for the face.  ",1
3962,A bird will chase after prey with the wings spread and kill by striking with swift blows of the feet. ,0
3963,Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick them directly. ,0
3964,"There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. ",0
3965,"Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. ",0
3966,"Occasionally, like other raptors, they will hold down a food item with their feet while tearing it apart with their bill.  Food that cannot be digested is regurgitated as pellets 40â45 mm (1.6â1.8 in) in diameter and 30â100 mm (1.2â3.9 in) in length. ",1
3967,These are dropped on the ground usually near the roost or nest trees.  ,1
3968,"The secretarybird has a relatively short digestive tract in comparison to large African birds with more mixed diets, such as the kori bustard. ",0
3969,The foregut is specialised for the consumption of large amounts of meat and there is little need for the mechanical breakdown of food. ,0
3970,"The crop is dilated and the gizzard is nonmuscular, as in other carnivorous birds.  ",1
3971,The large intestine has a pair of vestigial ceca as there is no requirement for the fermentative digestion of plant material.  ,1
3972,Secretarybirds specialise in stomping their prey until it is killed or immobilised.  ,1
3973,This method of hunting is commonly applied to lizards or snakes.  ,1
3974,"An adult male trained to strike at a rubber snake on a force plate was found to hit with a force equal to five times its own body weight, with a contact period of only 10â15 milliseconds. ",0
3975,This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. ,0
3976,"Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. ",0
3977,"Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping and striking hunting method. ",0
3978,"However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. ",0
3979,"Ecophysiologist Steve Portugal and colleagues have hypothesised that the extinct Phorusrhacidae (terror birds) may have employed a similar hunting technique to secretarybirds because they are anatomically similar, although they are not closely related.  ",1
3980,"Secretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, except in the case of tawny eagles, which will steal their kills. ",0
3981,Eagles mainly steal larger prey and will attack secretarybirds both singly or in pairs. ,0
3982,"Secretarybird pairs are sometimes successful in driving the eagles away and may even knock them down and pin them to the ground.  Secretarybirds, like all birds, have haematozoan blood parasites that include Leucocytozoon beaurepairei Dias 1954 recorded from Mozambique.   ",1
3983,"Wild birds from Tanzania have been found to have Hepatozoon ellisgreineri, a genus that is unique among avian haematozoa in maturing within granulocytes, mainly heterophils.  ",1
3984,Ectoparasites include the lice Neocolpocephalum cucullare (Giebel) and Falcolipeurus secretarius (Giebel).  ,1
3985,"The secretarybird is depicted on an ivory knife handle recovered from Abu Zaidan in Upper Egypt, dating to the Naqada III culture (c. 3,200 BC).  ",1
3986,This and other knife handles indicate the secretarybird most likely occurred historically further north along the Nile.  ,1
3987,The secretarybird has traditionally been admired in Africa for its striking appearance and ability to deal with pests and snakes. ,0
3988,"As such it has often not been disturbed, although this is changing as traditional observances have declined.  ",1
3989,"It is a prominent feature on the coat of arms of South Africa, which was adopted in 2000.  ",1
3990,"With its wings outstretched, it represents growth, and its penchant for killing snakes is symbolic as the protector of the South African state against enemies.  ",1
3991,It is featured on the Sudanese presidential flag and presidential seal.  ,1
3992,"The secretarybird has been a common motif for African countries on postage stamps: over a hundred stamps from 37 issuers are known, including some from stamp-issuing entities such as Ajman, Manama, and the Maldives, regions where the bird does not exist, as well as the United Nations.  ",1
3993,"The Maasai people call it ol-enbai nabo, or ""one arrow"", referring to its crest feathers.  ",1
3994,"They have used parts of the bird in traditional medicine: its feathers could be burnt and the resulting smoke inhaled to treat epilepsy, its egg could be consumed with tea twice daily to treat headaches, and its fat could be boiled and drunk for child growth or livestock health.  ",1
3995,The Xhosa people call the bird inxhanxhosi and attribute great intelligence to it in folklore.  ,1
3996,The German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach proposed in 2008 that the secretarybird was recorded in the 13th-century work De arte venandi cum avibus by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. ,0
3997,Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. ,0
3998,The 16th-century French priest and traveller AndreÌ Thevet also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species.  ,1
3999,"In the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks, one of the residents of Naboombu, the assistant to King Leonidas, is a secretarybird. ",0
4000,Both the secretarybird and the king are voiced by Lennie Weinrib.  ,1
4001,In 1968 the species became protected under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.  ,1
4002,"The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the secretarybird in 2016 as a vulnerable species and as Endangered in 2020, due to a recent rapid decline across its entire range.  ",1
4003,"Although widespread, the species is thinly distributed across its range; its population has been estimated in 2016 to be anywhere between 6,700 and 67,000 individuals.  Long term monitoring across South Africa between 1987 and 2013 has shown that populations have declined across the country, even in protected areas such as Kruger National Park due to bush encroachment, an increase in the tall vegetation cover,  resulting in loss of open habitat that the species prefers.  ",1
4004,"As a population, the secretarybird is mainly threatened by loss of habitat due to fragmentation by roads and development and overgrazing of grasslands by livestock.   ",1
4005,Some adaptation to altered areas has been recorded but the trend is for decline.  ,1
4006,The first successful rearing of a secretarybird in captivity occurred in 1986 at the Oklahoma City Zoo. ,0
4007,"Although secretarybirds normally build their nests in the trees in the wild, the captive birds at the zoo built theirs on the ground, which left them open to depredation by local wild mammals. ",0
4008,"Therefore, the zoo staff removed the eggs from the nest each time they were laid so that they could be incubated and hatched at a safer location.  ",1
4009,The species has also been bred and reared in captivity at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.[29 The Siberian accentor (Prunella montanella) is a small passerine bird that breeds in northern Russia from the Ural Mountains eastwards across Siberia. ,0
4010,"It is migratory, wintering in Korea and eastern China, with rare occurrences in western Europe and northwestern North America. ",0
4011,"Its typical breeding habitat is subarctic deciduous forests and open coniferous woodland, often close to water, although it also occurs in mountains and spruce taiga. ",0
4012,"It inhabits bushes and shrubs in winter, frequently near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods. ",0
4013,"The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. ",0
4014,"The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium (""eyebrow""). ",0
4015,The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. ,0
4016,"Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. ",0
4017,"In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation. ",0
4018,"Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a large and stable population. ",0
4019,"It is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. ",0
4020,"October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching as far as the United Kingdom. ",0
4021,"The accentors are a family of small ground-living insectivorous birds, most of which are found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. ",0
4022,"All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. ",0
4023,These are of comparable size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat.  ,1
4024,"However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.  ",1
4025,"On his return from his pioneering expedition to central and eastern Russia in 1768â1774, the Russia-based German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas formally described the Siberian accentor in 1776 as Motacilla montanella.   ",1
4026,The accentors were moved to their current genus by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.  ,1
4027,"""Accentor"" comes from the old scientific name for the Alpine accentor, Accentor collaris. ",0
4028,"It derives from Late Latin and means ""sing with another"" (ad + cantor).  ",1
4029,"The genus name Prunella is from the German Braunelle, ""dunnock"", a diminutive of braun, ""brown"", and the specific montanella is a diminutive of Latin montanus, ""mountain"".  ",1
4030,The Siberian accentor is on average 14.5 centimetres (5.7 in) long and weighs 17.5 grams (0.62 oz). ,0
4031,"The adult of the nominate race has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. ",0
4032,"The head has a dark brown crown, a long, wide pale yellow supercilium, a blackish patch behind the eye and grey sides to the neck. ",0
4033,"The underparts are ochre yellow, becoming strongly buff on the flanks and greyish on the lower belly. ",0
4034,There are rich chestnut streaks on the sides of the breast and the flanks.  ,1
4035,"The iris is a warm red-brown, the sharply pointed bill is dark and the legs are reddish.  ",1
4036,"The female has slightly duller underparts with weaker streaking, and the juvenile is overall duller with brown spots on the breast and chest.  ",1
4037,"Juvenile birds in autumn also show more wear to the tail feathers and the tertials that cover the folded wing, and they often have a duller iris colour than the adults.  ",1
4038,"The subspecies P. m. badia is somewhat smaller and darker than the nominate form, with richer brown upperparts, deeper buff underparts, and rustier flank streaks.  ",1
4039,Adults undergo a complete moult between July and September after breeding has finished. ,0
4040,"Juvenile birds have a partial moult in the same period, replacing the head, body and some wing covert feathers.  ",1
4041,"The only species that can potentially be confused with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. ",0
4042,"The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.   ",1
4043,"The male's song, given from the top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, variously described as similar to that of the Japanese accentor,  the dunnock  or the black-throated accentor.  ",1
4044,"Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.  ",1
4045,"The Siberian accentor breeds in a belt across northern Russia east from just west of the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern Siberia. ",0
4046,"This species winters in small numbers in Mongolia,  but only rarely in Japan.  ",1
4047,"The breeding habitat is subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs are also found in mountains and spruce taiga.   ",1
4048,"In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods.  ",1
4049,Siberian accentors leave the north of their breeding range from mid-September onwards but may stay for a further month or two in the south. ,0
4050,"In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and southeasternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.  ",1
4051,"Vagrant birds have been recorded in Belarus,  Kazakhstan, Lebanon and several European countries,  as well as in North America.  ",1
4052,"Most North American records have been in western Alaska and British Columbia, but as of February 2018 there had been records of single birds away from the Pacific coast in Alberta, Idaho and Montana.  ",1
4053,"Alaskan records, like those in western Europe, are mainly from late September to November; occurrences in Canada are less predictable, although mostly in autumn and winter,  and mostly at bird feeders.  ",1
4054,"October and early November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of Siberian accentors into western Europe, including first records for Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK,  in some cases attracting national attention and hundreds of twitchers.    ",1
4055,"Prior to 2015, only 32 individuals had been recorded in western Europe, the majority in Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 231 were reported. ",0
4056,"Records were from the Czech Republic (1), Denmark (11), Estonia (9), Finland (72), Germany (12), Hungary (1), Latvia (9), Lithuania (4), Netherlands (1), Norway (11), Poland (11), Russian Karelia (3), Sweden (71), the UK (14) and the Ukraine (2). ",0
4057,"Four additional birds in Sweden and one in Finland were not positively identified as Siberian, rather than black-throated, accentors. ",0
4058,Those birds that were reliably aged all appeared to be in first-winter plumage.    ,1
4059,"One of the UK birds lingered in Scotland, where it was found in February 2017.  ",1
4060,"Most of the birds found were on well-watched coasts and islands, and 25% were trapped; in the Baltic states, the proportion of trapped discoveries were much higher, and all finds in Lithuania were of captured birds. ",0
4061,"It is likely that many more birds were present but were not detected away from the migration watch points and bird observatories, especially in the south and southeast of the Baltic region. The UK Met Office suggested that the influx of accentors was driven by strong and persistent easterly winds from Siberia,  partially driven by a high-pressure area centred over Scandinavia.  ",1
4062,Another weather system produced easterlies in western Asia during the same period.  ,1
4063,"The weather conditions that carried the accentors so far west also brought large numbers of other Siberian migrants, including a record arrival of yellow-browed warblers in northwest Europe and a sprinkling of extreme eastern rarities such as the UK's first pale-legged leaf warbler and the Netherlands' second eastern crowned warbler.   ",1
4064,"In addition to the weather systems, other factors leading to the irruption may have included the widespread forest fires in that summer and autumn. ",0
4065,"In June, 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres) of woodland was burning, and by September the smoke cloud extended over several thousand kilometres and reached an altitude of 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). ",0
4066,Migrating birds may have moved west to avoid flying through the smoke. ,0
4067,The preceding hot summer may also have led to undetected breeding west of the known range involving birds seeking the cooler habitat preferred by this species.  ,1
4068,"There have been suggestions that the accentor influx was augmented by high breeding success in Siberia in 2016, but there is no direct data to support that, and no obvious increase in numbers reaching North America.  Siberian accentors are typically skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover.  ",1
4069,"They have an above average ability to maintain their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.  ",1
4070,The breeding season of the Siberian accentor is from June to August. ,0
4071,"Little is known about territorial or breeding behaviour, but birds of the nominate subspecies tend to occur in small groups of two to six closely spaced nests. ",0
4072,"This clumping does not appear to be shown by the southern subspecies, P. m. badia. ",0
4073,"The nest is an open cup built 0.4â8 metres (1 ft 4 inâ26 ft 3 in) above the ground in a dense shrub, or where branches fork in a tree. ",0
4074,The nest is constructed from coarse vegetation such as twigs and leaves and lined with hair or fine grasses.  ,1
4075,The eggs are a glossy deep blue-green and measure 18.6 by 13.7 millimetres (0.73 in Ã 0.54 in); they weigh about 1.9 grams (0.067 oz). ,0
4076,The clutch of four to six eggs is incubated by the female for about ten days to hatching and the downy brown-black chicks are then fed by both parents. ,0
4077,"Two broods may be produced annually in the south of the range, just one further north.  ",1
4078,"The Siberian accentor feeds mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near snow fields. ",0
4079,"Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being carried to the nest at each visit.  ",1
4080,"Seeds may be consumed in winter, and the accentors may also then feed near human habitation. ",0
4081,"Food plants include crowberry, bistort, and members of the aramanth and birch families.  ",1
4082,"The total population for the Siberian accentor is uncertain, although estimates for the small European part of the range vary from 100 to 500 breeding pairs. ",0
4083,"The breeding range is estimated as 2.2 million square kilometres (0.85 million sq mi), and the population is considered overall to be large and stable. ",0
4084,"For this reason, the Siberian accentor is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although as a northern breeding species it may in the long term be affected by climate change.  ",1
4085,"Breeding densities have been recorded as over 30 pairs/km2  in northwestern Russia, depending on habitat, generally becoming lower, around 5 pairs/km2 in the east of the range. ",1
4086,"Weather is also a factor, with an atypically high density of 7.4 birds/km2 being recorded in the Taymyr Peninsula in 1983.   ",1
4087,"The Siberian accentor is parasitised by the taiga tick, which can host the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease.[30The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a passerine bird of the sparrow family, Passeridae, found around the Indus valley region in South Asia. ",0
4088,"It is also known as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. ",0
4089,"Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. ",0
4090,"As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. ",0
4091,"Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species. ",0
4092,Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. ,0
4093,"Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. ",0
4094,"The species was discovered around 1840, but went undetected for several decades afterwards. ",0
4095,"Within its Indus valley breeding range in Pakistan and western India, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with thorny scrub and tall grass. ",0
4096,"During the non-breeding season, some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran. ",0
4097,"Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. ",0
4098,The Sind sparrow is social while feeding and gathers in small groups both while breeding and during winter dispersal. ,0
4099,"It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging close to the ground. ",0
4100,"Nests are made in the branches of thorny trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. ",0
4101,"Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season. ",0
4102,"The Sind sparrow is very similar to the house sparrow, and both sexes resemble their counterparts of that species, but it is slightly smaller and males and females each have features that distinguish them as Sind sparrows. ",0
4103,"The Sind sparrow is 13 cm (5.1 in) long, while the common South Asian subspecies of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus indicus, is 15 cm (5.9 in) long. ",0
4104,"Wingspans range from 6.2 to 7.0 cm (2.4 to 2.8 in), tails from 4.7 to 5.7 cm (1.9 to 2.2 in), and tarsi measure 1.6â1.9 centimetres (0.63â0.75 in).  ",1
4105,The breeding male has a short and narrow black bib and a broad chestnut eye stripe that does not meet the mantle.   ,1
4106,The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. ,0
4107,The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut.  ,1
4108,"Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head.   ",1
4109,The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. ,0
4110,"With a culmen length of 1.1â1.3 centimetres (0.43â0.51 in), the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.   ",1
4111,"The Sind sparrow's chirping chup call is softer, less strident, and higher pitched than that of the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished.   ",1
4112,The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.    ,1
4113,"The Sind sparrow was first formally described by Edward Blyth, from a specimen collected by Alexander Burnes at Bahawalpur in around 1840.   Blyth's description was published in an issue of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal which, although dated 1844, was published only in 1845.  ",1
4114,"The sparrow was not recorded until 36 years later, despite the efforts of noted ornithologists Allan Octavian Hume in Sindh and William Thomas Blanford in eastern Iran.   ",1
4115,"This was probably because of its general similarity to the house sparrow,  though additionally, Blyth's description of the species incorrectly described its rump feathers as maroon, and a description by Thomas C. Jerdon contained similar errors.  ",1
4116,"Commenting on his unsuccessful search, Hume wrote that the hundreds of house sparrows he killed in pursuit of the Sind sparrow ""ought to form a heavy load"" on Blyth's conscience, and that if the Sind sparrow existed ""it would be only decent for it   to put on an appearance with as little delay as possible"".  ",1
4117,"The Sind sparrow was rediscovered by Scrope Berdmore Doig in 1880, in the Eastern Nara district.    ",1
4118,"Ernst Hartert considered it a subspecies of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus pyrrhonotus, in his Die VoÌgel der palaÌarktishen Fauna,  but Doig and Claud ",1
4119,Ticehurst both found that the two species bred in the same areas without interbreeding.   ,1
4120,"The specific epithet of the Sind sparrow, pyrrhonotus, comes from the Greek purrhos (""flame-coloured""), and -noÌtos (""-backed"").  ",1
4121,"E. C. Stuart Baker suggested the English name rufous-backed sparrow, but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species. ",0
4122,"This name refers to Sindh, a province now in Pakistan which makes up a large part of the Sind sparrow's range, and the jungle habitat of the bird (in the word's original sense of tangled dry thicket).   ",1
4123,"This name is shortened to jungle sparrow or Sind sparrow, of which the first was used in the IOC World Bird List, until Sind sparrow was adopted in 2009.  ",1
4124,"The Sind sparrow is a member of the genus Passer, which contains the house sparrow and around twenty other species.  ",1
4125,"In a 1936 review of the house sparrow's relatives, German ornithologist Wilhelm Meise suggested that the Sind sparrow evolved from an isolated population of house sparrows, noting that the Indus valley is a centre of small bird types.  ",1
4126,"British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered the Sind sparrow to be part of the ""Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow"" group including the house sparrow, though not one with a particularly close relationship with the house sparrow. ",0
4127,"Summer-Smith suggested that these species separated 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period, when sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the Indus River Delta, where he thought the Sind sparrow evolved.   ",1
4128,"However, studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate an earlier origin of Passer species, with speciation occurring as early as the late Miocene and early Pliocene, about 5 million years ago.  ",1
4129,"Hume and Ticehurst observed a resemblance, and a possible relation, between the Sind sparrow and the Dead Sea sparrow of the Middle East and Balochistan.   ",1
4130,"William Robert Ogilvie-Grant and Henry Ogg Forbes saw a resemblance to the Abd al-Kuri sparrow, endemic to the island of Abd al-Kuri, in their 1899 description of that species,  noted upon by Guy M. Kirwan in a 2008 study.  ",1
4131,"The Sind sparrow has a restricted distribution, primarily occurring within the Indus valley of Pakistan, and the lower parts of the tributaries of the Indus in the Punjab region. ",0
4132,"Its distribution extends from the Indus Delta north to the Kabul River near Nowshera and the Jhelum near Nurpur Noon, extending east into India as far as the Delhi area.   ",1
4133,"It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of Balochistan,   and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran.   ",1
4134,"The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range,  and no threats are known to the survival of the species, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  ",1
4135,"During winter, it often makes short-distance movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India.    Longer movements may occur, as suggested by a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.  ",1
4136,"It mostly breeds in acacia and tamarisk scrub and tall grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands.  ",1
4137,"The construction and expansion of irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India.    ",1
4138,"It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. ",0
4139,"In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.  ",1
4140,"The Sind sparrow is gregarious, generally forming small groups of four to six birds while feeding. ",0
4141,"It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water.   ",1
4142,"During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks of as many as 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats.   ",1
4143,The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. ,0
4144,"It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings.  ",1
4145,"Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.  Nesting occurs during a period of several months between April to September, the timing depending on rainfall, during which two clutches are raised by most pairs. ",1
4146,Sind sparrows build nests in the upper branches of thorny trees or the ends of thin branches hanging over water.    ,1
4147,"The nest is an untidy dome of grass and other plant matter, such as tamarisk twigs, roots, and reeds, with a diameter of about 9 to 18 cm (3.5 to 7.1 in). ",0
4148,"The nest has an entrance located higher up on the sides, is somewhat flat on top, and is lined with softer plant material and feathers.  ",1
4149,The birds may sometimes build below the nests of egrets or extend the nest of a baya weaver or pied myna.   ,1
4150,Both the male and female take part in nest building and incubation.[8 ,0
4151,"Scrope Doig described the eggs as being markedly smaller than the house sparrow's, measuring 0.7 Ã 0.5 in (1.3 Ã 1.8 cm) and similarly greenish or greyish with highly variable blotches, striations, and other markings.[43Rallus plateni ",0
4152,"The snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni), also known as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail, is a large flightless rail and the only member of the genus Aramidopsis. ",0
4153,"The species is endemic to Indonesia, and it is found exclusively in dense vegetation in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton. ",0
4154,"The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a rufous patch on the hind-neck. ",0
4155,"The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris. ",0
4156,The typical call is the snoring: ee-orrrr sound that gives the bird its English name. ,0
4157,"Its inaccessible habitat and retiring nature mean that the snoring rail is rarely seen and as a result, little is known of its behaviour. ",0
4158,"Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. ",0
4159,It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. ,0
4160,"Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. ",0
4161,"The rails are a large and very widespread family, with nearly 150 species. ",0
4162,"They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. ",0
4163,"Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands, 32 have lost the ability to fly.  ",1
4164,"The snoring rail was first classified as Rallus plateni by German ornithologist August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius in 1886,  but was moved to its current monotypic genus Aramidopsis by English zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1893.  ",1
4165,"Following Taylor (1998), it was considered to be more similar to the Inaccessible Island and white-throated rails than to members of the genus Rallus,  but a 2012 mitochondrial gene study suggests that it should actually be placed in Gallirallus, with Lewin's rail and the slaty-breasted rail as its closest relatives.[5Aramidopsis  derives from the genus name of the limpkin, Aramus and the Greek suffix opsis, ""resembling"". ",1
4166,"Although the rail shares the origin of its name with the South American Aramides species,  its distinctive bill, thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group.  ",1
4167,"The species name plateni commemorates Carl Constantin Platen, a German doctor who collected birds and butterflies in the Malay Archipelago  and gave Blasius his specimen of the rail.  ",1
4168,"The common name refers to the rail's distinctive call, and was given to the bird as der Vogel Schnarch (the snoring bird) by German entomologist Gerd Heinrich when he rediscovered the species in 1932.  ",1
4169,The snoring rail is 30 cm (12 in) long and weighs 143â160 g (5.0â5.6 oz). ,0
4170,"It is flightless, with short wings, a very short tail and strong legs and feet. ",0
4171,"The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey, apart from a white chin, and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange-red. ",0
4172,"Most of the rest of the upperparts are brown, and the belly, flanks, and undertail have white barring. ",0
4173,"The male has black legs, a yellow iris and a brown and greenish down-curved bill. ",0
4174,"The female is similar but has a brighter hindneck colour, less white on the chin, a red iris, a cream and reddish bill and blue-grey legs. ",0
4175,"The blue-faced rail is similar in size, but is chestnut above and black below, and the buff-banded rail has strongly marked upperparts, breast, and head. ",0
4176,"The call, given frequently, is a short wheez followed by a distinctive snoring ee-orrrr. ",0
4177,"The species is an uncommon Indonesian endemic of lowland and hill forests in northern, north central and southeastern Sulawesi.  ",1
4178,The typical habitat of this species is dense vegetation in wet areas. ,0
4179,"This may include impenetrable bamboo and liana in forests, rattan in regrown forests, or elephant grass and bushes on the hillsides of Minahassa Peninsula. ",0
4180,Claims of the species occurring in rice fields are believed to be due to confusion with the buff-banded rail.  ,1
4181,"The snoring rail occurs from sea level to 1,300 m (4,300 ft).  ",1
4182,Its inaccessible habitat and sparse distribution means that little is known about this species. ,0
4183,"A few birds were shot by Platen and another expedition led by Paul Sarasin and his second cousin, Fritz, between 1893 and 1898,  but the rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until Heinrich found it almost at the end of a two-year survey of Sulawesi, then known as Celebes. ",1
4184,"He described it as ""the most priceless catch that I have ever hunted or will hunt"".  ",1
4185,"More than a decade later, Dutch ornithologist Louis Coomans de Ruiter also took a year to find the rail, despite concentrating on known suitable habitat.  There were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989.   ",1
4186,"Sight records remain infrequent,  and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied.  The snoring rail catches crabs in highland streams, and these crustaceans may be a major dietary item. ",1
4187,"It also forages in muddy areas, and has been recorded as consuming lizards.  ",1
4188,"Nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983,  but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting.  The snoring rail is restricted to Sulawesi and Buton and has an estimated population of 3,500â15,000 individuals. ",1
4189,"Its numbers are thought to be decreasing, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  ",1
4190,"It may always have been thinly spread, but there has been widespread deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. ",0
4191,"The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. ",0
4192,"The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators.   ",1
4193,"A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.[19Turdus musicus[2 ",0
4194,The song thrush (Turdus philomelos) is a thrush that breeds across the West Palearctic. ,0
4195,It has brown upper-parts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three recognised subspecies. ,0
4196,"Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry. ",0
4197,"The song thrush breeds in forests, gardens and parks, and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. ",0
4198,"Although it is not threatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe, possibly due to changes in farming practices. ",0
4199,The song thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four to five dark-spotted blue eggs. ,0
4200,"It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an ""anvil"" on which to break open the shells of snails. ",0
4201,"Like other perching birds (passerines), it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey. ",0
4202,"The song thrush was described by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, and still bears its original scientific name, Turdus philomelos.  ",1
4203,"The generic name, Turdus, is the Latin for thrush, and the specific epithet refers to a character in Greek mythology, Philomela, who had her tongue cut out, but was changed into a singing bird. ",0
4204,"Her name is derived from the Ancient Greek Î¦Î1Î»Î¿ philo- (loving), and Î1⁄4ÎμÌÎ»Î¿Ï melos (song).  The dialect names throstle and mavis both mean thrush, being related to the German drossel and French mauvis respectively.[5 ",1
4205,] Throstle dates back to at least the fourteenth century and was used by Chaucer in the Parliament of Fowls.  ,1
4206,"Mavis is derived via Middle English mavys and Old French mauvis from Middle Breton milhuyt meaning ""thrush. ",0
4207,A molecular study indicated that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of Turdus thrushes after they spread north from Africa. ,0
4208,They are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the Caribbean islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.   ,1
4209,"The song thrush has three subspecies, with the nominate subspecies, T. p. philomelos, covering the majority of the species' range. ",0
4210,"T. p. hebridensis, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland. ",0
4211,"It is the darkest subspecies, with a dark brown back, greyish rump, pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.  ",1
4212,"T. p. clarkei, described by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909, and named for William Eagle Clarke, breeds in the rest of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east. ",0
4213,"It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form, an olive-tinged rump and rich yellow background colour to the underparts. ",0
4214,It is a partial migrant with some birds wintering in southern France and Iberia. ,0
4215,"This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe, and with T. p. hebridensis in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland, and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics.  ",1
4216,"Additional subspecies, such as T. p. nataliae of Siberia, proposed by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929, are not widely accepted.  ",1
4217,The song thrush (as represented by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5 centimetres (8 to 9.25 in) in length and weighs 50â107 grammes (1.8 to 3.8 oz). ,0
4218,"The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. ",0
4219,"The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. ",0
4220,The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. ,0
4221,"The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks on the back and wing coverts.  ",1
4222,"The most similar European thrush species is the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird has a strong white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. ",0
4223,"The mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), although much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.  ",1
4224,"The song thrush has a short, sharp tsip call, replaced on migration by a thin high seep, similar to the redwing's call but shorter. ",0
4225,The alarm call is a chook-chook becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger. ,0
4226,"The male's song, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches, is a loud clear run of musical phrases, repeated two to four times, filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret, and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry. ",0
4227,"It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race, but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies.  ",1
4228,"For its weight, this species has one of the loudest bird calls.  ",1
4229,"An individual male may have a repertoire of more than 100 phrases,  many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. ",1
4230,"Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones,  and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.  ",1
4231,"The song thrush breeds in most of Europe (although not in the greater part of Iberia, lowland Italy or southern Greece), and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. ",0
4232,"It reaches to 75Â°N in Norway, but only to about 60Â°N in Siberia. ",0
4233,"Birds from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, but only some of the birds in the milder west of the breeding range leave their breeding areas.  ",1
4234,In Great Britain song thrushes are commonly found where there are trees and bushes. ,0
4235,"Such areas include parks, gardens, coniferous and deciduous woodland and hedgerows.  Birds of the nominate subspecies were introduced to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons.  ",1
4236,"In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands.  ",1
4237,"Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne.  ",1
4238,"In New Zealand, there appears to be a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species,  and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country.  ",1
4239,"As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.  ",1
4240,"The song thrush typically nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. ",0
4241,"It breeds up to the tree-line, reaching 2,200 metres (7,250 ft) in Switzerland. ",0
4242,"The island subspecies T. p. hebridensis breeds in more open country, including heathland, and in the east of the song thrush's Eurasian range, the nominate subspecies is restricted to the edge of the dense conifer forests.  ",1
4243,"In intensively farmed areas where agricultural practices appear to have made cropped land unsuitable, gardens are an important breeding habitat. ",0
4244,"In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that habitat making up only 2% of the total area. ",0
4245,"The winter habitat is similar to that used for breeding, except that high ground and other exposed localities are avoided;  however, the island subspecies T. p. hebridensis will frequent the seashore in winter.  ",1
4246,"The song thrush is not usually gregarious, although several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats, perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird, fieldfare, redwing and dark-throated thrush.  ",1
4247,"Unlike the more nomadic fieldfare and redwing, the song thrush tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas.  ",1
4248,"This is a monogamous territorial species, and in areas where it is fully migratory, the male re-establishes its breeding territory and starts singing as soon as he returns. ",0
4249,"In the milder areas where some birds stay year round, the resident male remains in his breeding territory, singing intermittently, but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until pair formation begins in the early spring.  ",1
4250,"During migration, the song thrush travels mainly at night with a strong and direct flight action. ",0
4251,"It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short crossings (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact.  Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, but the majority of birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. ",1
4252,Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia.  ,1
4253,"Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.  ",1
4254,"The female song thrush builds a neat cup-shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, in the case of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. ",0
4255,"She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple;  they are typically 2.7 cm Ã 2.0 cm (1.06 in Ã 0.79 in) size and weigh 6.0 g (0.21 oz), of which 6% is shell.  ",1
4256,"The female incubates the eggs alone for 10â17 days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. ",0
4257,"Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range.  ",1
4258,"On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. ",0
4259,"The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months. The song thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs.  ",1
4260,"However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird.  ",1
4261,"The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130 years, retained the ability to recognize and reject non-mimetic eggs.  ",1
4262,"Adult birds may be killed by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels.    ",1
4263,"As with other passerine birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush.  ",1
4264,"A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma.  Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas of central and eastern Europe and Russia,  and ",1
4265,"Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.  ",1
4266,"The song thrush is omnivorous, eating a wide range of invertebrates, especially earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. ",0
4267,"Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.  ",1
4268,Land snails are an especially important food item when drought or hard weather makes it hard to find other food. ,0
4269,"The thrush often uses a favorite stone as an ""anvil"" on which to break the shell of the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption.  ",1
4270,Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails.  ,1
4271,"The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms, slugs, snails and insect larvae.  ",1
4272,"The grove Snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is regularly eaten by the song thrush, and its polymorphic shell patterns have been suggested as evolutionary responses to reduce predation;  however, song thrushes may not be the only selective force ",1
4273,"The song thrush has an extensive range, estimated at 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles), and a large population, with an estimated 40 to 71 million individuals in Europe alone.  ",1
4274,"In the western Palaearctic, there is evidence of population decline, but at a level below the threshold required for global conservation concern (i.e., a reduction in numbers of more than 30% in ten years or three generations) and the IUCN Red List categorises this species as of ""Least Concern"".  In Great Britain and the Netherlands, there has been a more than 50% decline in population, and the song thrush is included in regional Red Lists.   ",1
4275,The decreases are greatest in farmlands (73% since the mid-1970s) and believed to be due to changes in agricultural practices in recent decades.  ,1
4276,"The precise reasons for the decline are not known but may be related to the loss of hedgerows, a move to sowing crops in autumn rather than spring, and possibly the increased use of pesticides. ",0
4277,These changes may have reduced the availability of food and of nest sites.  ,1
4278,"In gardens, the use of poison bait to control slugs and snails may pose a threat.  ",1
4279,"In urban areas, some thrushes are killed while using the hard surface of roads to smash snails.  ",1
4280,"The song thrush's characteristic song, with melodic phrases repeated twice or more, is described by the nineteenth-century British poet Robert Browning in his poem Home Thoughts, from Abroad ",0
4281,": That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,Lest you should think he never could recaptureThe first fine careless rapture!  ",1
4282,"The song also inspired the nineteenth-century British writer Thomas Hardy, who spoke in Darkling Thrush of the bird's ""full-hearted song evensong/Of joy illimited"",  but twentieth-century British poet Ted Hughes in Thrushes concentrated on its hunting prowess: ""Nothing but bounce and/stab/and a ravening second"".  Nineteenth-century Welsh poet Edward Thomas wrote 15 poems concerning blackbirds or thrushes, including The Thrush: I hear the thrush, and I seeHim alone at the end of the laneNear the bare poplar's tip,Singing continuously.  ",1
4283,"In The Tables Turned, Romantic poet William Wordsworth references the song thrush, writing Hark, how blithe the throstle singsAnd ",0
4284,"The song thrush is the emblem of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. ",0
4285,"It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.  A few English pubs and hotels share the name Throstles Nest.  ",1
4286,"Thrushes have been trapped for food from as far back as 12,000 years ago  and an early reference is found in the Odyssey: ""Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings against some snare rigged up in thicketsâflying in for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them. ",1
4287,"Hunting continues today around the Mediterranean, but is not believed to be a major factor in this species' decline in parts of its range.  ",1
4288,"In Spain, this species is normally caught as it migrates through the country, often using birdlime which, although banned by the European Union, is still tolerated and permitted in the Valencian Community.  ",1
4289,"In 2003 and 2004 the EU tried, but failed, to stop this practice in the Valencian region.   Up to at least the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice.  ",1
4290,"As with hunting, there is little evidence that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations.[11 ",0
4291,"The splendid fairywren (Malurus splendens) is a passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae. ",0
4292,It is also known simply as the splendid wren or more colloquially in Western Australia as the blue wren. ,0
4293,The splendid fairywren is found across much of the Australian continent from central-western New South Wales and southwestern Queensland over to coastal Western Australia. ,0
4294,"Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism, the male in breeding plumage is a small, long-tailed bird of predominantly bright blue and black colouration. ",0
4295,"Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. ",0
4296,It comprises several similar all-blue and black subspecies that were originally considered separate species. ,0
4297,"Like other fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; the birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such trysts.  Male wrens pluck pink or purple petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.  ",1
4298,"The habitat of the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, generally with ample vegetation for shelter. ",0
4299,"Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, it has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. ",0
4300,The splendid fairywren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds. ,0
4301,"The splendid fairywren is one of eleven species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea.  ",1
4302,Within the genus it is most closely related to the superb fairywren. ,0
4303,"These two ""blue wrens"" are closely related to the purple-crowned fairywren of north-western Australia.  ",1
4304,"Specimens were initially collected at King George Sound, and the splendid fairywren then described as Saxicola splendens by the French naturalists Jean ReneÌ Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830,  three years before John Gould gave it the scientific name of Malurus pectoralis and vernacular name of banded superb-warbler.  ",1
4305,"Though he correctly placed it in the genus Malurus, the specific name of the former authors took priority. ",0
4306,"The specific epithet is derived from the Latin splendens, which means ""shining"". Like other fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is unrelated to the true wren. ",1
4307,"It was first classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae by Richard Bowdler Sharpe,   though it was later placed in the warbler family Sylviidae by the same author,  before being placed in the newly recognised family Maluridae in 1975.  ",1
4308,"More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the family Meliphagidae (the honeyeaters), and the family Pardalotidae within a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.   ",1
4309,The splendid fairywren is also alternatively named the splendid blue wren. ,0
4310,"Initially, three of the subspecies were considered separate species as they were each originally described far from their borders with the others. ",0
4311,"However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. ",0
4312,"Thus in 1975, they were then reclassified as subspecies of the splendid fairywren. ",0
4313,"In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. ",0
4314,At some time in the past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. ,0
4315,"As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. ",0
4316,These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. ,0
4317,This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. ,0
4318,"A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.

4319,"The splendid fairywren is a small, long-tailed bird 14 cm (5.5 in) long. ",0
4320,"Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism, the breeding male is distinctive with a bright blue forehead and ear coverts, a violet throat and deeper rich blue back wings, chest and tail with a black bill, eye band and chest band. ",0
4321,The blue breeding plumage of the male is often referred to as nuptial plumage. ,0
4322,The non-breeding male is brown with blue in the wings and a bluish tail. ,0

4326,They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring.  ,1
4327,"Some older males have remained blue all year, moulting directly from one year's nuptial plumage to the next.  ",1
4328,"Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules.  ",1
4329,"The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.  ",1
4330,The call is described as a gushing reel;  this is harsher and louder than other fairywrens and varies from individual to individual.  ,1
4331,"A soft single trrt serves as a contact call within a foraging group, while the alarm call is a tsit. ",0
4332,Cuckoos and other intruders may be greeted with a threat posture and churring threat.  ,1
4333,The splendid fairywren is widely distributed in the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia. ,0
4334,Habitat is typically dry and shrubby; mulga and mallee in drier parts of the country and forested areas in the southwest.  ,1
4335,"The western subspecies splendens and eastern black-backed fairywren (subspecies melanotus) are largely sedentary, although the turquoise fairywren (subspecies musgravei) is thought to be partially nomadic.  ",1
4336,"Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas.  Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.  ",1
4337,"Like all fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. ",0
4338,"Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces,  with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. ",1
4339,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  ",1
4340,"During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. ",0
4341,"Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. ",0
4342,The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. ,0
4343,Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.[36 ,0
4344,] Groups of two to eight splendid fairywrens remain in their territory and defend it year-round.  Territories average 4.4 ha (11 acres) in woodland-heath areas;  ,1
4345,"The group consists of a socially monogamous pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. ",0
4346,"Splendid fairywrens are sexually promiscuous, each partner mating with other individuals and even assisting in raising the young from such trysts. ",0
4347,Over a third of offspring are the result of an 'extramarital' mating.  Helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young.  Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.  ,1
4348,"Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat (Felis catus) and black rat ",0
4349,"Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. ",0
4350,"While doing this, the head, neck and tail of the bird are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
4351,"Several courtship displays by splendid fairywren males have been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so named for the similarity of movements to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground.  ",1
4352,The 'face fan' display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.  ,1
4353,"Another interesting habit of males of this and other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens.  ",1
4354,Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. ,0
4355,"Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves.  ",1
4356,"It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life,  but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. ",1
4357,"Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. ",0
4358,Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. ,0
4359,"In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter. ",0
4360,"Researchers at Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago published a paper in Behavioral Ecology in 2010 showing that male splendid fairywrens sing display-like vocalizations (Type II song) in response to predator calls. ",0
4361,"The trills ""hitchhike"" on the predator's vocalization and the female splendid fairywrens, which have become more alert due to the predator calls, also respond more strongly to this type II song than when it's given without a predator call preceding it.[45 ",0
4362,"] Breeding occurs from late August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. ",0
4363,"The nest is built by the female; it is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side close to the ground and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea.  ",1
4364,One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. ,0
4365,"A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 Ã 16 mm (1â2 Ã 5â8 in), are laid.  ",1
4366,"The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15 days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10â13 days, by which time they are fledged.  ",1
4367,"Young birds remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group.  ",1
4368,"Splendid fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chalcites basalis),  with the shining bronze cuckoo (Chalcites lucidus) also recorded.  ",1
4369,"The splendid fairywren is predominantly insectivorous; its diet includes a wide range of small creatures, mostly arthropods such as ants, grasshoppers, crickets, spiders and bugs. ",0
4370,"This is supplemented by small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit.  ",1
4371,They mostly forage on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres above the ground; this has been termed 'hop-searching'. ,0
4372,"Unusually for fairywrens, they may also occasionally forage in the canopy of flowering gums.  Birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups as this foraging practice does render them vulnerable to a range of predators. ",1
4373,"Food can be scarce in winter and ants are an important 'last resort' option, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet.  Adult fairywrens feed their young a different diet, conveying larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers to nestlings.  ",1
4374,"The bird was intended to be illustrated on an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope released on 12 August 1999;  however, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated instead.[57 ",1
4375,The spotted green pigeon or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is a species of pigeon which is most likely extinct. ,0
4376,"It was first mentioned and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. ",0
4377,"The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though the idea that it was related to the Nicobar pigeon (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. ",0
4378,"Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. ",0
4379,"Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. ",0
4380,"It may have been native to an island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, and it has been suggested that a bird referred to as titi by Tahitian islanders was this bird. ",0
4381,"In 2014, a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire. ",0
4382,"The surviving specimen is 32 cm (13 in) long, and has very dark, brownish plumage with a green gloss. ",0
4383,"The neck feathers are elongated, and most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips. ",0
4384,"It has a black bill with a yellow tip, and the end of the tail has a pale band. ",0
4385,"It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill, but there is no evidence for this. ",0
4386,"Unlike the Nicobar pigeon, which is mainly terrestrial, the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly arboreal, and fed on fruits. ",0
4387,"The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area, and may have disappeared due to over-hunting and predation by introduced animals around the 1820s. ",0
4388,The spotted green pigeon was first mentioned and described by the English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work A General Synopsis of Birds.  ,1
4389,"Latham stated that he had seen two specimens, in the collections of the English major Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks, but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections, and their provenance is unknown. ",0
4390,"Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer James Cook, and Davies received specimens from contacts in New South Wales, implying a location in the South Pacific Ocean, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. ",0
4391,"After Davies' death, his specimen was bought in 1812 by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th ",0
4392,"Smith-Stanley's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount (which had perhaps been taxidermised by Davies himself) into a study skin. ",0
4393,"This museum later became World Museum, where the specimen is housed today (numbered WML 3538), but Banks' specimen is now lost. ",0
4394,"Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of the British antiquarian Ashton Lever, but it is unknown which specimen this was based on; it could have been either, or a third individual. ",0
4395,"Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work A General History of Birds, and though the basis for his illustration is unknown, it differs from Davies' specimen in some details. ",0
4396,"It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the Leverian collection, since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as ""deep ferruginous"" (rust-coloured), a feature also depicted in his own illustration.    ",1
4397,"The spotted green pigeon was scientifically named by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. ",0
4398,"The original binomial name Columba maculata means ""spotted pigeon"" in Latin. ",0
4399,"Latham himself accepted this name, and used it in his 1790 work Index ornithologicus. ",0
4400,"Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species. ",0
4401,"Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; the English naturalist James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus Ptilinopus in 1826, and the German ornithologist Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested that it was a juvenile Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) in 1827.  ",1
4402,"The Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about ""doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified"" in 1893.  ",1
4403,"In 1898, the Scottish ornithologist Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species, after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. ",0
4404,"He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon, Caloenas.  ",1
4405,"In 1901, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild and the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to Caloenas, but suggested that it was probably an ""abnormity"", though more than one specimen had been recorded.  ",1
4406,"The spotted green pigeon was only sporadically mentioned in the literature throughout the 20th century; little new information was published, and the bird remained an enigma.  ",1
4407,"In 2001, the English writer Errol Fuller suggested that the bird had been historically overlooked because Rothschild (an avid collector of rare birds) dismissed it as an aberration, perhaps because he did not own the surviving specimen himself. ",0
4408,"Fuller considered it a valid, extinct species, and also coined an alternative common name for the bird: the Liverpool pigeon.  ",1
4409,"On the basis of Fuller's endorsement, BirdLife International listed the spotted green pigeon as ""Extinct"" on the IUCN Red List in 2008; it was previously ""Not Recognized"".   ",1
4410,"In 2001, the British ornithologist David Gibbs stated that the spotted green pigeon was only superficially similar to the Nicobar pigeon, and possibly distinct enough to warrant its own genus (related to Ptilinopus, Ducula, or Gymnophaps). ",0
4411,"He also hypothesised that the bird might have inhabited a Pacific island, based on stories told by Tahitian islanders to the Tahitian scholar Teuira Henry in 1928 about a green and white speckled bird called titi.  ",1
4412,"The American palaeontologist David Steadman disputed the latter claim in a book review, noting that titi is an onomatopoeic word (resembling the sound of the bird) used especially for shearwaters (members of Procellariidae) in east Polynesia.  ",1
4413,"The English ornithologists Julian P. Hume and Michael Walters, writing in 2012, agreed with Gibbs that the bird warranted generic status.  ",1
4414,"In 2020, after examining historical texts to clarify the origin and extinction date of the spotted green pigeon, the French ornithologist Philippe Raust pointed out that the information in Henry's 1928 book Ancient Tahiti was not gathered by her, but by her grandfather, the English reverend John Muggridge Orsmond, who collected ancient Tahitian traditions during the first half of the 19th century. ",0
4415,"The book devotes several pages to birds of Tahiti and its surroundings, including extinct ones, and the entry that Gibbs had linked to the spotted green pigeon reads: ""The titi, which cried âtitiâ, now extinct in Tahiti, was speckled green and white and it was the shadow of the mountain gods"". ",0
4416,"The titi was included in the paragraph relating to pigeons, which suggests it was well recognised as such, and Raust found it consistent with the spotted green pigeon. ",0
4417,"Though Steadman had dismissed the idea based on the name titi also being used for shearwaters, Raust pointed out that this name was used for a wider variety of birds with vocalisations that sound like ""titi"". ",0
4418,"Raust also noted that an 1851 Tahitian dictionary compiled by the Welsh reverend John Davies included the word tiÌtiÌhopeâore, which was used as a synonym for the titi of Henry in a 1999 dictionary. ",0
4419,"Based on definitions in Davies' dictionary, Raust translated this name as ""tiÌtiÌ without (a long) tail. ",0
4420,"Raust suggested this name was used to distinguish it from the long-tailed koel (Urodynamis taitensis), which is called ""tiÌtiÌ oroveo"", and which is somewhat similar to Latham's illustration of the spotted green pigeon, being dark brown with paler spots and underparts. ",0
4421,"Raust believed that the study of these texts reinforced the Tahitian origin of the spotted green pigeon, and suggested this could be confirmed if possible bones of this species were one day found on Tahiti and analysed for DNA. ",0
4422,"So far, few paleontological sites on Tahiti have been studied, and fossils found there have not yet revealed unknown species.  ",1
4423,"In 2014, an ancient DNA analysis by the Australian geneticist Tim H. Heupink and colleagues compared the genes of the only spotted green pigeon specimen with that of other pigeons, based on samples extracted from two of its feathers. ",0
4424,One of the resulting phylogenetic trees (or cladograms) is shown below:  ,1
4425,Didunculus strigirostris (Tooth-billed pigeon) Goura victoria (Victoria crowned pigeon) Goura cristata (Western crowned pigeon) Raphus cucullatus (Dodo) Pezophaps solitarius (Rodrigues solitaire) Caloenas maculata (Spotted green pigeon) Caloenas nicobarica (Nicobar pigeon) The spotted green pigeon was shown to be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. ,0
4426,"The genetic distance between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. ",0
4427,"This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. ",0
4428,The genus Caloenas was placed in a wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. ,0
4429,That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. ,0
4430,"A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. ",0
4431,"This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon.   ",1
4432,The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.  ,1
4433,The distribution of the Nicobar pigeon and the Kanaka pigeon (which does not appear to have had diminished flight abilities) suggests dispersal through island hopping and an origin for the spotted green pigeon in Oceania or southeast Asia. ,0
4434,"The fact that the closest relatives of Caloenas were the extinct subfamily Raphinae (first demonstrated in a 2002 study), which consists of the dodo from Mauritius and the Rodrigues solitaire from Rodrigues, indicates that the spotted green pigeon could also have originated somewhere in the Indian Ocean. ",0
4435,"In any case, it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location, like its relatives. ",0
4436,"That the Caloenas pigeons were grouped in a clade at the base of the lineage leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the flightless dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly, and reached the Mascarene Islands by island hopping from south Asia.   ",1
4437,Latham's 1823 description of the spotted green pigeon from A General History of Birds (expanded from the one in A General Synopsis of Birds) reads as follows: ,0
4438,"Bill black, tipped with pale yellow; round the eye somewhat naked; general colour of the plumage dark green, and glossy; the head and neck are darker than the rest, and of one plain colour; the feathers of the neck long and narrow, like the hackles of a Cock; every feather of the wings and scapulars tipped with a spot of very pale cinereous white, with a point running upwards, somewhat triangular: quills and tail black; the feathers of the first tipped with cinereous white, those of the last with ferruginous white, and even at the end: belly, thighs, and vent, dusky black: the legs are brown, and the shins covered half way with downy feathers; claws black. ",0
4439,"We have only seen two specimens; one in the collection of Gen. Davies, the other in possession of Sir Joseph Banks. ",0
4440,"In a drawing of one at Sir Ashton Lever's, the end of the tail is deep ferruginous.  ",1
4441,"Most literature addressing the spotted green pigeon simply repeated Latham's descriptions, adding little new information, until Gibbs published a more detailed description in 2001, followed by the museum curator Hein van Grouw in 2014. ",0
4442,"The surviving specimen measures 32 cm (12.6 in) in length, though study specimens are often stretched or compressed during taxidermy, and may therefore not reflect the length of a living bird. ",0
4443,"The spotted green pigeon appears to have been smaller and slenderer than the Nicobar pigeon, which reaches 40 cm (15.7 in), and the Kanaka pigeon appears to have been 25% larger than the latter. ",0
4444,"At 126 mm (5 in) in length, the tail is longer than that of the Nicobar pigeon, but the head is smaller in relation. ",0
4445,"The bill is 20 mm (0.8 in), and the tarsus measures 33 mm (1.3 in). ",0
4446,"Though the wings of the specimen appear to be short and rounded, and have been described as being 175 mm (6.9 in) long, van Grouw discovered that the five outer primary feathers have been pulled out of each wing, and suggested that the wings would therefore had been about 50 mm (2 in) longer in life, around 225 mm (9 in) in total. ",0
4447,"This is in accordance with Latham's 1823 illustration, which shows a bird with longer wings.    ",1
4448,"The bill of the specimen is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers on the upper side, almost to the nostrils. ",0
4449,"The lores are naked, and the upper part of the head is sooty black. ",0
4450,"The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. ",0
4451,"The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. ",0
4452,Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. ,0
4453,"Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. ",0
4454,"The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. ",0
4455,"The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. ",0
4456,"The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. ",0
4457,"This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. ",0
4458,"The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.   ",1
4459,"When examining the specimen, van Grouw noticed that the legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. ",0
4460,"The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. ",0
4461,"The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. ",0
4462,"The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob at the base of its bill, similar to that of the Nicobar pigeon. ",0
4463,"This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. ",0
4464,"This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. ",0
4465,"The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. ",0
4466,"It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. ",0
4467,"Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.   ",1
4468,"The triangular spots of the spotted green pigeon are not unique among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and are the result of lack of melanin deposition during development. ",0
4469,"The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. ",0
4470,"The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. ",0
4471,"The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. ",0
4472,"The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).  ",1
4473,"Though the plumage of the spotted green pigeon resembles that of the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also similar to that of species in the imperial pigeon genus Ducula. ",0
4474,"The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles can be seen in the goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). ",0
4475,"The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. ",0
4476,"Therefore, van Grouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. ",0
4477,He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.  ,1
4478,"The behaviour of the spotted green pigeon was not recorded, but theories have been proposed based on its physical features. ",0
4479,"Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. ",0
4480,"After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird would not have been terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. ",0
4481,"He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. ",0
4482,"It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. ",0
4483,"By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. ",0
4484,"The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon are similar to those of frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. ",0
4485,The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. ,0
4486,"Believing that the wings were short and round, Gibbs thought the bird was not a strong flyer, and therefore not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). ",0
4487,"In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, van Grouw also thought it would have been a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. ",0
4488,"It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.   ",1
4489,"Raust pointed out that the fact that Polynesians considered the titi to emanate from mountain gods suggests that it lived in remote, high-altitude forests.  ",1
4490,"The spotted green pigeon is most likely extinct, and may already have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area.  ",1
4491,The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. ,0
4492,Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.  ,1
4493,"Raust agreed that the bird's extinction occurred during the 1820s, pointing out that the entry of the titi in Henry's 1928 book was based on much older accounts.[14Ara autochthones Olson, 1978 (lapsus) The St. Croix macaw (Ara autocthones) or Puerto Rican macaw, is an extinct species of macaw whose remains have been found on the Caribbean islands of St. Croix and Puerto Rico. ",0
4494,It was described in 1937 based on a tibiotarsus leg bone unearthed from a kitchen midden at a pre-Columbian site on St. Croix. ,0
4495,"A second specimen consisting of various bones from a similar site on Puerto Rico was described in 2008, while a coracoid from Montserrat may belong to this or another extinct species of macaw. ",0
4496,The St. Croix macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived on the Caribbean islands. ,0
4497,"Macaws were frequently transported long distances by humans in prehistoric and historical times, so it is impossible to know whether species known only from bones or accounts were native or imported. ",0
4498,"As it is only known from bones, the St. Croix macaw's color is not known. ",0
4499,Extant macaws can generally be grouped in either large-body or small-body size clusters. ,0
4500,"Yet, the bones of the St. Croix macaw are intermediate in size between the two, and it was slightly larger than the extinct Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor). ",0
4501,Only the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis) and Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) are similar in size. ,0
4502,It differed from other macaws in various skeletal details and shared several features with only the genus Ara. ,0
4503,"Like other macaw species in the Caribbean, the St. Croix macaw is believed to have been driven to extinction by humans, as indicated by the fact that its remains were found in kitchen middens. ",0
4504,"In 1934, the archeologist Lewis J. Korn (working under the Museum of the American Indian) excavated a kitchen midden (a dump for domestic waste) at a site near Concordia on the southwestern coast of St. Croix, one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea. ",0
4505,"The midden was located 370 m (400 yd) inland from the beach, and its depth was around 76 cm (30 in). ",0
4506,"Bones of mammals, birds, turtles, and fish were obtained from the bottom of the deposit, with bird bones being concentrated at the mid-level. ",0
4507,"The exact age of the material could not be determined, but since no European origin objects were found in the deposit, it was assumed to be pre-Columbian, between 500 and 800 years old. 23 species of birds were represented among the well-preserved bones, some of which were extinct. ",0
4508,"In 1937, the ornithologist Alexander Wetmore identified several species among these bones, including a left tibiotarsus (lower leg bone) of an immature macaw, which was unexpected since no such birds were previously known from St. Croix.  ",1
4509,"Wetmore made the tibiotarsus the holotype specimen of a new macaw species, which he placed in the genus Ara, as Ara autocthones. ",0
4510,"The specific name is from the Ancient Greek Î±ÏÌÏÎ¿ÌÏÎ ̧ÏÎ1⁄2 (autochthon), meaning native or aborigine. ",0
4511,"The holotype is housed along with the other bones found at the U.S. National Museum of Natural History, cataloged as USNM 483530. ",0
4512,"Though numerous other now-extinct macaws had been described from the Caribbean based on old accounts alone, the only other species described based on physical remains at the time was the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor), which was known from skins. ",0
4513,"Though Wetmore conceded that many uncertainties were surrounding the bone, especially regarding its affinities to other Caribbean macaws, he thought it appropriate to designate it as a new species.    ",1
4514,"In 1978, the ornithologist Storrs L. Olson (using the spelling autochthones) agreed that the bone belonged to a macaw not assignable to any known species, but noted it may not have been native to St. Croix, since indigenous Caribbeans are known to have kept and traded macaws over long distances.  ",1
4515,"In 1983, he indicated that if the macaw had indeed been transported, the specific name would be a misnomer.  ",1
4516,"The zoologist Elizabeth S. Wing agreed in 1989 that the macaw could have been traded,  but the ornithologists Matthew I. Williams and David W. Steadman stated in 2001 that given the evidence for other macaws having existed in the region, there was no reason why St. Croix could not have had an indigenous species.  ",1
4517,LoÌpez found several associated bones of a single bird (cataloged as USNM 44834) at the HernaÌndez ColoÌn archeological site on the eastern bank of the Cerrillos-BucanaÌ river in south central Puerto Rico. ,0
4518,"The archeological site represents a pre-Columbian Saladoid-Ostionoid village of around 15,000 m2 (3.7 acres) in size, situated on an alluvial terrace. ",0
4519,"Both cultural and faunal remains were excavated, and the macaw remains were found in a kitchen midden deposit that has been dated to around 300 AD. ",0
4520,"The specimen consists of partial bones including the left coracoid (missing a portion of the bone's ""head""), both ends of the left humerus, the upper end of the right radius, the left carpometacarpus (missing one metacarpal), the left femur (lacking the lower end), the right tibiotarsus (lacking part of the upper articular surface), upper and lower portions of the left tibiotarsus, as well as unidentified elements. ",0
4521,"LoÌpez assigned the specimen to Ara autocthones (it had been assigned to Ara sp. in 2004, indicating uncertain classification within the genus Ara), as its tibiotarsus is identical in size to the holotype.   Olson and MaÌiz ",1
4522,"LoÌpez considered it likely that Ara autocthones was endemic to the West Indian region rather than a species transported from the mainland by Native Americans, as it is far more likely a species restricted to islands would have been driven extinct. ",0
4523,"Since they found it unlikely the bird occurred naturally on St. Croix and questioned whether it could even have occurred naturally on Puerto Rico, they considered the name autocthones ""probably one of the worst possible choices"" for the species. ",0
4524,"Though fossils of the parrot genera Amazona and Aratinga have been found in pre-human sites on Puerto Rico, none such belonging to macaws have been found. ",0
4525,LoÌpez conceded that macaws are unlikely to be found in cave deposits and noted that the Cuban macaw's fossils had been found in aquatic deposits. ,0
4526,"They also pointed out that various animal species were transported and kept in captivity by Native Americans â for example the Puerto Rican hutia (Isolobodon portoricensis, an extinct rodent) and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi, an extinct flightless rail) were both transported to St. Croix and found in kitchen middens.  Olson and MaÌiz ",1
4527,"LoÌpez pointed out that a coracoid from the island of Montserrat (reported by Williams and Steadman in 2001, and cataloged as UF 4416) could belong to the macaw of St. Croix and Puerto Rico or the Cuban macaw, as it was within the size range of the two (smaller than the former).[3 ",0
4528,] The ornithologists James W. Wiley and Guy M. Kirwan instead suggested in 2013 that the bone from Montserrat could belong to the extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (A. guadeloupensis) of Guadeloupe.  ,1
4529,"Ara autocthones has been referred to as the St. Croix macaw, but, after more remains were described from Puerto Rico, it has also been called the Puerto Rican macaw.    ",1
4530,The ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw argued in 2017 that the latter was a more appropriate name since he found it more plausible that it naturally occurred on Puerto Rico and had been transported to the Virgin Islands.  ,1
4531,"As many as 13 now-extinct species of macaw have lived on the Caribbean islands, it has been suggested. ",0
4532,"Still, many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and represented only hypothetical species.  ",1
4533,"In addition to the St. Croix macaw, only two other endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is possibly known from subfossils.   ",1
4534,"Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean, both in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans and in historic times by Europeans and natives. ",0
4535,Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans and were among the gifts offered to the explorer Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. ,0
4536,"Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; it is also possible that these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere.  ",1
4537,The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean are likely to be resolved only through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.   ,1
4538,"Since only bones are known of the St. Croix macaw, nothing can be said about its coloration.  ",1
4539,"While the holotype tibiotarsus appears to belong to a fully grown individual, the fact that the bone is slightly spongy at the ends indicates it was immature. ",0
4540,"This left tibiotarsus is 77.7 mm (3.06 in) in total length, 9.4 mm (0.37 in) in breadth from side to side across the lower end, and the smallest breadth from side to side of the shaft is 3.9 mm (0.15 in). ",0
4541,"Though similar to the same bone in the Cuban macaw, it is wider from side to side ",0
4542,(comparisons between the lower ends of their tibiotarsi indicate it was a slightly larger bird). ,0
4543,"The holotype tibiotarsus is intermediate in size between those of large macaws such as the scarlet macaw (Ara macao) and the military macaw (Ara militaris), and the small chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus). ",0
4544,"Compared to the tibiotarsi of extant macaws, the bone is more slender and has a slightly greater hindwards development of the upper end. ",0
4545,"Apart from this, its only distinguishing feature is that its dimensions do not fall within those of other known species. ",0
4546,The slender proportions of the bone and more elongated ridges around the upper end show it is a macaw and distinguishes it from the Amazon parrots such as the large imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis).  ,1
4547,The tibiotarsus of the assigned specimen is essentially identical in size to the holotype. ,0
4548,"It is 74.5 mm (2.93 in) from the upper articular surface, 47.2 mm (1.86 in) from the lower end of the fibular crest to the external condyle (the round prominences at the end of a bone), 11.4 mm (0.45 in) deep through the inner cnemial crest (a ridge at the front side of the head), 5.2 by 4.0 mm (0.20 by 0.16 in) wide and deep at the mid shaft, and 10.1 mm (0.40 in) wide at the lower end. ",0
4549,"The estimated length of the coracoid is 43.5 mm (1.71 in) from its head to the internal corner of the sternal facet, 26.5 mm (1.04 in) from the base of the procoracoid process to the internal corner of the sternal facet, the glenoid facet is 10.5 by 6.1 mm (0.41 by 0.24 in) wide and deep, the shaft is 5.2 by 4.4 mm (0.20 by 0.17 in) wide and deep at midpoint, and the sternal facet is 10.5 mm (0.41 in) wide. ",0
4550,"The upper width of the humerus is 19.9 mm (0.78 in), the depth through its external tuberosity is 12.8 mm (0.50 in), the depth of its head is 6.2 mm (0.24 in), the width of the lower end is about 15.5 mm (0.61 in), and the height and width of the radial condyle is 7.4 by 5.0 mm (0.29 by 0.20 in). ",0
4551,"The carpometacarpus is 55.8 mm (2.20 in) long, its upper depth is 14.3 mm (0.56 in), the trochlea (a grooved structure where bones join) is 5.7 mm (0.22 in) wide, and the shaft is 4.5 by 5.0 mm (0.18 by 0.20 in) at midpoint. ",0
4552,The upper part of the radius is 6.0 mm (0.24 in) at its greatest diameter. ,0
4553,"The estimated length of the femur is 51.5 mm (2.03 in), its upper width is 12.5 mm (0.49 in), the depth through its trochanter is 8.2 mm (0.32 in), the head is 6.2 mm ",0
4554,"(0.24 in) deep, and the shaft is 4.9 by 5.4 mm (0.19 by 0.21 in) wide and deep at its midpoint.  Olson and MaÌiz ",1
4555,"LoÌpez stated that extant macaws fall into two size-clusters, representing large and small species. ",0
4556,"In contrast, the St. Croix macaw was distinct in being intermediate between the two clusters, with only the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis) and Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) being similar in size. ",0
4557,They observed that the pectoral attachment on the humerus is less excavated compared to those two macaws. ,0
4558,"In contrast, the capital groove (a groove separating two parts of the humerus's head) is wider. ",0
4559,"The head of the femur is more massive, and when seen from the back, is more excavated under the head, neck, and trochanter. ",0
4560,"In contrast, the femur's more robust shaft is similar to that of Ara but dissimilar to Anodorhynchus. ",0
4561,The tibiotarsus' length is shorter than in the blue-throated macaw but longer than in Lear's macaw. ,0
4562,"In contrast, the lengths of the coracoid, carpometacarpus, and femur are smaller than in either.  Olson and MaÌiz ",1
4563,LoÌpez ruled out the specimen from Puerto Rico belonging to the Amazon parrots by pointing out characters found only in Ara macaws. ,0
4564,"The coracoid is more elongated and has a relatively narrow shaft, and the ventral lip of the glenoid facet (equivalent to the glenoid fossa of mammals) protrudes more. ",0
4565,"The carpometacarpus is proportionally much longer with a process on the alular metacarpal that is not curved at its upper part, while the ectepicondylar process (a bony elevation) and the attachment of pronator brevis (one of the two pronation muscles in the wing) on the humerus is placed farther upwards. ",0
4566,"The femur has a proportionally larger head, and the tibiotarsus has a narrower internal condyle and a distinctive inner cnemial crest that is more pointed and extends further upwards.  ",1
4567,"All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans (in prehistoric and historical times), though hurricanes and disease may have contributed. ",0
4568,"Native Caribbeans hunted macaws and held them captive for later use as food, but also as pets. ",0
4569,"Since they are known from kitchen midden deposits, the macaws from Puerto Rico and St. Croix were evidently also used for subsistence.   ",1
4570,"It is likely that the St. Croix macaw became extinct due to these factors, but the date it happened is unknown.[10 ",0
4571,"The superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus) is a passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae, and is common and familiar across south-eastern Australia. ",0
4572,"It is a sedentary and territorial species, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. ",0
4573,"Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. ",0
4574,"Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island. ",0
4575,"Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; the birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. ",0
4576,Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. ,0
4577,"The superb fairywren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. ",0
4578,"It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane. ",0
4579,The superb fairywren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds. ,0
4580,"The superb fairywren is one of eleven species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea.  Within the genus, the superb fairywren's closest relative is the splendid fairywren; these two ""blue wrens"" are also related to the purple-crowned fairywren of northwestern Australia.  ",1
4581,"William Anderson, surgeon and naturalist on Captain James Cook's third voyage, collected the first superb fairywren specimen in 1777 while traveling off the coast of eastern Tasmania, in Bruny Island's Adventure Bay. ",0
4582,He classified it in the genus Motacilla because its tail reminded him of the European wagtails. ,0
4583,"Anderson did not live to publish his findings, although his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782.  ",1
4584,"The genus Malurus was later described by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.  ",1
4585,"Shortly after the First Fleet's arrival at Port Jackson, Sydney, the bird gained the common name superb warbler.  ",1
4586,In the 1920s came common names wren and wren-warblerâboth from its similarity to the European wrenâand fairywren.  ,1
4587,"The bird has also been called Mormon wren, a reference to observations of one blue-plumaged bird accompanied by many brown-plumaged birds, which were incorrectly assumed to be all female.  and the Gunai call it deeydgun, meaning ""little bird with long tail"".  ",1
4588,Both it and the variegated fairywren are known as muruduwin to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.  ,1
4589,"Other alternative names for the superb fairywren include the Australian fairywren, blue wren, superb blue fairywren, and superb blue wren. ",0
4590,"Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is unrelated to the true wren. ",0
4591,It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family ,0
4592,"Muscicapidae   and later as a member of the warbler family Sylviidae  before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975.  More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.   ",1
4593,To help resolve this a high-quality 1.07âGb reference genome was sequenced in 2019.  ,1
4594,"In his 1982 monograph, Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens.  ",1
4595,At some time in the past it was split into south-western (splendid) and south-eastern (superb) enclaves. ,0
4596,"As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. ",0
4597,"In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected with the rest of the continent via a land bridge. ",0
4598,This gave rise to the subspecies cyaneus as it became isolated when the sea levels rose. ,0
4599,The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained.  ,1
4600,"A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.  ",1
4601,"The superb fairywren is 14 cm (5 1â2 in) long  and weighs 8â13 g (0.28â0.46 oz),  with males on average slightly larger than females.  ",1
4602,"The average tail length is 5.9 cm (2 1â3 in),  among the shortest in the genus.  ",1
4603,"Averaging 9 mm (0.4 in) in subspecies cyaneus and 8 mm (0.3 in) in subspecies cyanochlamys,  the bill is relatively long, narrow and pointed and wider at the base. ",1
4604,"Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs.  ",1
4605,"Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting with black and grey-brown. ",0
4606,The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays.  ,1
4607,"The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. ",0
4608,"Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. ",0
4609,The bill is brown in females and juveniles  and black in males after their first winter.  ,1
4610,"Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect.  ",1
4611,"Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. ",0
4612,"Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules.  ",1
4613,"The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.  ",1
4614,"Vocal communication among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory.  ",1
4615,"The basic, or Type I, song is a 1â4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10â20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females.  ",1
4616,"Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given in response to the calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds.  ",1
4617,"The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. ",0
4618,"It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. ",0
4619,"It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain.  ",1
4620,"The superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. ",0
4621,The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.  ,1
4622,"The superb fairywren is common throughout most of the relatively wet and fertile south-eastern corner of the continent, from the south-east of South Australia (including Kangaroo Island and Adelaide) and the tip of the Eyre Peninsula, through all of Victoria, Tasmania, coastal and sub-coastal New South Wales and Queensland, through the Brisbane area and extending inland â north to the Dawson River and west to Blackall; it is a common bird in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.  ",1
4623,"It is found in wooded areas, generally with plenty of undergrowth, and has also adapted to urban existence and can be found in gardens and urban parks as long as there is an undergrowth of native plants nearby.  ",1
4624,"Lantana (Lantana camara), a prolific weed in Australia, has also been beneficial in providing shelter in disturbed areas,  as has the introduced and invasive blackberry  ",1
4625,"Unlike other fairywrens, it appears to benefit from the urban environment and has out-competed the introduced house sparrow in one study on the grounds of the Australian National University in Canberra.  ",1
4626,Colonies of wrens can be found in Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney's urbanized centre.  ,1
4627,It is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments.  ,1
4628,Forestry plantations of pine and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.  ,1
4629,"Like all fairywrens, the superb fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. ",0
4630,"Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces,  with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. ",1
4631,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  ",1
4632,"During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. ",0
4633,"Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. ",0
4634,The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. ,0
4635,Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.  ,1
4636,"The superb fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with pairs or groups of 3â5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round.   ",1
4637,"The group consists of a social pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. ",0
4638,These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young.  Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.  ,1
4639,"Major nest predators include Australian magpies, butcherbirds, laughing kookaburra, currawongs, crows and ravens, shrike-thrushes as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox , cat and black rat.  ",1
4640,Superb fairywrens may utilise a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. ,0
4641,"The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
4642,"A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls. ",0
4643,This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.  ,1
4644,"The 'sea horse flight', named for its seahorse-like undulations, is one such display. ",0
4645,"During this exaggerated flight, the maleâwith his neck extended and his head feathers erectâtilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground.  ",1
4646,The 'face fan' display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.  ,1
4647,"During the reproductive season, males of this and other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. ",0
4648,The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. ,0
4649,"Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves.  ",1
4650,"Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life,  though both males and females will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. ",1
4651,"Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.  ",1
4652,"Breeding occurs from spring through to late summer; the nest is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side generally close to the ground, under 1 m (3.3 ft), and in thick vegetation. ",0
4653,Two or more broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. ,0
4654,"A clutch of three or four matte white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 mm Ã 16 mm (0.47 in Ã 0.63 in).  ",1
4655,"The eggs are incubated for 14 days, after which they hatch within 24 hours. ",0
4656,"Newborn chicks are blind, red and featherless, though quickly darken as feathers grow. ",0
4657,Their eyes open by day five or six and are fully feathered by day 10. ,0
4658,All group members feed and remove fecal sacs for 10â14 days. ,0
4659,Fledglings are able to feed themselves by day 40 but remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group or assuming a dominant position in the original group. ,0
4660,In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods and repel cuckoos or predators.  ,1
4661,"Superb fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite Horsfield's bronze cuckoo and, less commonly, the shining bronze cuckoo and fan-tailed cuckoo.  ",1
4662,"They eat a wide range of small creatures (mostly insects such as ants, grasshoppers, shield bugs, flies, weevils and various larvae) as well as small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit.   ",1
4663,"Their foraging, termed 'hop-searching', occurs on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high.  ",1
4664,"Because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators, birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups. ",0
4665,"During winter, when food may be scarce, ants are an important 'last resort' food, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet.  Nestlings, in contrast to adult birds, are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers.  ",1
4666,The superb fairywren breeding male is used as an emblem by the Bird Observation & Conservation Australia.  ,1
4667,"On 12 August 1999, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated for an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope meant to depict a splendid fairywren.  Called the blue wren as it was then known, it had previously featured on a 2s.5d. stamp, released in 1964, which was discontinued with the advent of decimal currency.[72 ",1
4668,"The Tahiti rail, Tahitian red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail (Hypotaenidia pacifica) is an extinct species of rail that lived on Tahiti. ",0
4669,"It was first recorded during James Cook's second voyage around the world (1772â1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. ",0
4670,"As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. ",0
4671,"The Tahiti rail appears to have been closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the Tongan subspecies of that bird. ",0
4672,"The Tahiti rail was 9 inches (23 centimetres) long, and its colouration was unusual for a rail. ",0
4673,"The underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like supercilium were white, and the upper parts were black with white dots and bands. ",0
4674,"The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. ",0
4675,"The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. ",0
4676,The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless and nested on the ground. ,0
4677,"It is said to have been seen in open areas, marshes, and in coconut plantations. ",0
4678,Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects and occasionally copra (coconut meat). ,0
4679,The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. ,0
4680,"It appears to have become extinct some time after 1844 on Tahiti, and perhaps as late as the 1930s on Mehetia. ",0
4681,The Tahiti rail was found on the South Pacific island of Tahiti (part of the Society Islands archipelago) by naturalists who were part of the British explorer James Cook's second voyage around the world (1772â1775). ,0
4682,"The bird was illustrated by Georg Forster, who accompanied his father, the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster. ",0
4683,"The father and son were tasked with recording natural history during the voyage, with Georg as the draughtsman. ",0
4684,The plate (no. 128) is life-sized and is kept at the Natural History Museum in London. ,0
4685,"No specimens of this bird have been preserved, but it is presumed that Forster saw a skin.  ",1
4686,"The English naturalist John Latham referred to this species as the ""Pacific Rail"" in 1785, and the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin formally named the bird Rallus pacificus in 1789, based on Latham's account.   ",1
4687,"In 1844 the German naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein published J. R. Forster's account of the discoveries made during the journey, including his description of the Tahiti rail.   ",1
4688,"J. R. Forster indicated that the Tahiti rail was called Oomnaa or EboonaÌa on Tahiti and neighbouring islands, and OomeÌia-KeteoÌw on Tonga, though he specified only Tahiti and nearby islands as being part of its range.   Tevea also appears to have been one of the common names for the bird. ",1
4689,"In 1967 the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the bird was said by Polynesians to have also existed on the island of Mehetia near Tahiti ""a generation ago"", as reported to Greenway by the amateur naturalist Anthony Curtiss. ",0
4690,Phillip L. Bruner stated the bird was last recorded on Mehetia about fifty years earlier.  ,1
4691,"In 2012 the English ornithologist and artist Julian P. Hume referred to the claim that the bird lived on Mehetia as ""hearsay"" but regarded it as a possibility that it lived there and on other outlying islands.  ",1
4692,"In 2001 the English writer Errol Fuller stated that unlike some other ""hypothetical extinct species"" only known from old accounts, the Tahiti rail was sufficiently well documented for there to be no doubt that it existed.  ",1
4693,"The Tahiti rail has historically been confused with the extant Tongan subspecies of the buff-banded rail, Hypotaenidia philippensis ecaudata, which was also illustrated and described by the Forsters. ",0
4694,"In his 1783 description of the Tongan bird (wherein it was named Rallus eucaudata), the English ornithologist John Frederick Miller erroneously gave its locality as Tahiti, which led the Tahiti rail to be regarded as a junior synonym of the extant bird. ",0
4695,"He based his description on Forster's illustration (plate no. 127) of the Tongan bird, and Latham and Gmelin later repeated Miller's erroneous locality. ",0
4696,"The 1844 publication of Forster's description listed the Tongan bird as a variety of the Tahitian species, and similar schemes were suggested by later writers until 1953, when the New Zealand biologist Averil Margaret Lysaght pointed out Miller's locality mistake, which had been overlooked until that point, and kept the two birds separate.  ",1
4697,"In spite of the clarification, the Tongan bird was placed on a list of extinct birds in the 1981 book Endangered Birds of the World, and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was used to illustrate the Samoan wood rail (Gallinula pacifica), a completely different species, in the 1989 book Le Grand Livre des EspeÌcies Disparues.  ",1
4698,"Along with the buff-banded rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail has historically been placed in either the genus Hypotaenidia (as H. pacifica) or Gallirallus (as G. pacificus), and is currently classified in the former.     ",1
4699,"The specific name refers to the Pacific Ocean and is Latin for ""peaceful"".  ",1
4700,In 1977 the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that the Tahiti rail was an isolated form of buff-banded rail and perhaps belonged to a superspecies with that bird and the Wake Island rail (Hypotaenidia wakensis).  ,1
4701,"Rails are some of the most widespread terrestrial vertebrates, and have colonised practically all island groups, with many island species being flightless. ",0
4702,"In 1973 the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson argued that many insular flightless species of rails were descended from still extant flighted rails, that flightlessness had evolved independently and rapidly in many different island species, and that this feature is therefore of no taxonomic importance. ",0
4703,Flightlessness can be advantageous (especially where food is scarce) because it conserves energy by decreasing the mass of flight muscles; the absence of predators (particularly mammalian) and a reduced need for dispersal are factors that allow this feature to develop in island birds.  ,1
4704,"J. R. Forster stated the Tahiti rail was 9 inches (23 cm) long, which is small for a member of its genus. ",0
4705,Its colouration was also striking and unusual for a rail and it was described as being an attractive bird. ,0
4706,"The upper parts were black with white dots and bands (also referred to as spots and bars), and the underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like supercilium were white. ",0
4707,"The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. ",0
4708,"The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. ",0
4709,"The sexes were presumably similar, and the immature and juvenile were not described.   Forster's original description of the bird follows below, in a translation from Latin published by the English naturalist Walter Rothschild in 1907: ",1
4710,"Black with white spots or bars; abdomen, throat, and eyebrow white; hind neck ferruginous; breast grey; bill blood-red; iris red. ",0
4711,"Bill straight, compressed, narrowed at the top, thicker at the base, and blood-red. ",0
4712,"The mandibles subequal, pointed; the upper slightly curved, with the tip pale fuscous; gape medium. ",0
4713,"Four toes, slender, of which three point forward (are front toes). ",0
4714,"The middle one almost as long as the Tibia, the side ones of equal length shorter, the back one short, raised from the ground. ",0
4715,"Rectrices extremely short, black spotted with white, hardly to be distinguished from the coverts.   ",1
4716,"Forster also stated that the total length to the middle toe was 12.75 inches (324 mm) long, the bill was 1.1 inches (28 mm) long, the tibiae (shinbones) 2 inches (51 mm) long, and the middle toe 1.3 inches (33 mm) long.  ",1
4717,"The Tahiti rail was similar to the buff-banded rail in the pattern of the nape and supercilium, and its spots and bars, but was otherwise generally distinct from other members of its genus.  Forster's plate (which Fuller described as ""rather crude"" yet ""explicit"") became the basis for other depictions of the bird, by artists such as John Gerrard Keulemans (1907), Fenwick Lansdowne (1977), and Hume (2012). ",1
4718,"Keulemans' illustration was made for the 1907 book Extinct Birds (before Forster's original had been published) by Rothschild, who pointed out that the legs had been painted too brightly red in the new adaptation, when they should instead have been flesh-coloured.    ",1
4719,"Keulemans also depicted bars on the tail covert feathers not shown in the original, according to Ripley.  ",1
4720,"The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless, and nested on the ground. ",0
4721,"Bruner claimed to have gained information about the behaviour of the species from ""the few people who still remember the bird"". ",0
4722,"According to Bruner, the call of the bird was described as similar to that of other rails, though it differed in ending in a high-pitched whistle. ",0
4723,"It was said to have been seen in open areas, sometimes with other rails in marshes, and in coconut plantations. ",0
4724,"Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on copra (coconut meat). ",0
4725,"Its broken colour pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked ""shyness"".   ",1
4726,The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. ,0
4727,"The small, outlying islands off Tahiti also have rats, though there were no cats on Mehetia at the time of Greenway's writing in 1967.   ",1
4728,"According to Bruner, the bird was said to have been common on Tahiti until the end of the 19th century, beginning to decline thereafter; it had disappeared from there after 1844. ",0
4729,"It may have survived on the smaller, uninhabited island of Mehetia until the 1930s, perhaps due to the absence of cats.  ",1
4730,"Other extinct Tahitian birds include the Tahiti sandpiper and the black-fronted parakeet, and some species have disappeared from Tahiti itself but survive on other islands.  ",1
4731,"According to Olson, it is possible that hundreds of rail populations have become extinct from islands following the arrival of humans within the past 1500 years.[18 The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of the Palearctic. ",0
4732,"The tawny owl is a member of the genus Strix, that is also the origin of the family's name under Linnaean taxonomy.  ",1
4733,"Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either rufous, brown or grey. ",0
4734,Several of the eight recognised subspecies have each of the main colour variations.   ,1
4735,"This nocturnal bird of prey hunts a wide variety of prey species, but usually primarily takes small mammals such as rodents. ",0
4736,"Tawny owls usually hunt by dropping from a perch to seize their prey, which they typically swallow whole. ",0
4737,"In more urban areas, its diet includes a higher proportion of birds, while in arid subtropics many invertebrates such as insects are taken.    Other important prey can include frogs with other vertebrate prey taken fairly rarely.  Vision and well-developed hearing adaptations combined with silent flight aid its night ",1
4738,"The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to larger raptors, like eagle-owls or goshawks.   ",1
4739,"This species typically nests  in a tree hollow, wherein they are likely to gain protection of their eggs and young against potential predators.[6The tawny owl is non-migratory and highly territorial. ",0
4740,Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.   ,1
4741,"Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. ",0
4742,"Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, have led to a mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.  ",1
4743,"This is a robust owl that is quite distinct for its large, rounded head. ",0
4744,Tawny owls have no ear tufts but do possess a prominent facial disc rimmed in slightly dusky feathers.  ,1
4745,"Despite having a broad facial disc rim, the facial disc is largely indistinct from the surrounding feathers in markings and colour, unlike some other owls that have relative bold facial disc patterns.  ",1
4746,The eyes are blackish-brown rimmed (at times imperceptibly) narrowly by the pale fleshy edges of the blue-grey eyelids.  ,1
4747,"The underside feathers are barred in a dusky colour with several crossbars, producing a herringbone pattern.  ",1
4748,Their typical rich brownish colour often camouflages it well against a variety of woodland types.  ,1
4749,"Tawny owls are spotted with white along the line of the scapulars, forming a white spotted ""shoulder"".  ",1
4750,Tawny owls possess relatively thick and heavy legs and feet and the talons are rather powerful and quite decurved.   ,1
4751,"In flight they can appear fairly big and broad, large headed and rounded on the wings.  ",1
4752,"The tawny owl often flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and typically at a greater height. ",0
4753,"The flight of the tawny owl is relatively heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff.  ",1
4754,"They can appear to be a heavy flier but are capable of surprising maneuverability within woods, flying with utter silence.  ",1
4755,"As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe on the leading edge of the outer primaries.   Annual moult is usually complete in tawny owls but not all wing feathers are moulted each year.  ",1
4756,"Of 91 males and 214 females in Great Britain, 17-19% did not moult any primaries, while 1-6% replaced all primaries, about 6% of males and 2% of females annually replaced median-primaries, while about 11% of males and 4% of females replaced annually their median secondaries.  ",1
4757,Young individuals can sometimes be diagnosed to age roughly by the state of wing moult. ,0
4758,"However, some variation in wing moult accounts for mistaken identification by age of 3 year old owls for younger ages due to the fact that they retain some worn juvenile wing feathers. ",0
4759,Moult tends to occur after young fledge in late summer-early autumn for mature owls.  ,1
4760,The nominate race in particular has two main morphs which differ in their plumage colour. ,0
4761,"The predominant morphs are grey and rufous, with a more minor intermediate or brown morph also sometimes occurring in various races; sometimes each morph may intergrade.  ",1
4762,"There is some indication that pleiotropy has led to the colouring diversity in the species.  Studies, largely based in Italy and in Finland, based on contour feathers indicate that grey morph owls are more densely insulated and better suited to surviving cooler conditions, which is roughly in keeping with the respective morph distribution. ",1
4763,"Meanwhile, in warmer and wetter and/or more humid conditions, rufous morph individuals are better adapted.  ",1
4764,"However, similar studies on climate, habitat and colour morph found no strong correlation between colour morph, habitat and survivorship in Switzerland.  Studies on colour morphs also indicated that higher levels of melanin, such as darker rufous morphs, may suffer higher rates of parasitism, body mass loss through the season across all ages but on the contrary also had higher growth rates for nestlings and were more likely to breed every year than grey morphs in Italy and Switzerland regardless of prey resources than grey morphs.   ",1
4765,"Studies in Finland indicate that grey morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than other morphs. ",0
4766,The data on grey morphs having the aforementioned advantages is also supported in Italian data.    ,1
4767,"Although this might suggest that eventually the darker morphs could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the selection pressure in favour of the grey morph is reduced. ",0
4768,"The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.   ",1
4769,"In Poland, neither primary morph was necessary predominant, with 51.4% of 107 owls being rufous morph and 46.7% being grey morphs and this may qualify as a transitional zone.  ",1
4770,"Other areas studied for colour morph proportions showed the following, in England (sample size 31): 55% rufous 39% grey and 6% intermediate; in France (315): 65% rufous and 35% grey; in Spain (54): 26% rufous, 65% grey and 9% intermediate; in Germany (50): 10% rufous and 90% grey; in Czech Republic (102): 32.3% rufous, 61.8% grey and 5.9% intermediate; Switzerland (79): 33% rufous and 67% grey.  ",1
4771,"This species is sexually dimorphic; the female is notably larger than the male, often averaging up to 5% longer and can average more than 25% heavier.  ",1
4772,"This is sometimes called reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD) as it runs opposite of most birds, wherein males are usually larger, but almost all unrelated groups of birds of prey display some degree of RSD.  Of European owls ",1
4773,", the tawny owl ranks as fourth most dimorphic by weight and fifth most dimorphic by wing dimensions. ",0
4774,The prevalent hypothesis is that RSD occurs in birds of prey due to the considerable rigors of the breeding cycle.  Of the Strix in the Northern Hemisphere it is perhaps ,1
4775,Average length in Denmark was found to be 36.7 cm (14.4 in) in 10 males and 37.7 cm (14.8 in) in 18 females.  ,1
4776,Average total length in Spain was 38.9 cm (15.3 in) in 10 males and 39.3 cm (15.5 in) in 12 females.  ,1
4777,"Wingspan may vary from 81 to 105 cm (32 to 41 in).   In Denmark, the average wingspan in 9 males was 89.7 cm (35.3 in) and in 12 females was 91.9 cm (36.2 in) and in Spain the average was 87 cm (34 in) in 14 males and 88.7 cm (34.9 in) in 12 females.   ",1
4778,"Among standard measurements, across the various subspecies, the wing chord of males can range from 248 to 323 mm (9.8 to 12.7 in) whilst that of the female may vary from 255 to 343 mm (10.0 to 13.5 in). ",0
4779,Tail length can vary from 148 to 210 mm (5.8 to 8.3 in) while the less widely measured linear variants of total bill length have been reported at 28 to 35 mm (1.1 to 1.4 in) and tarsus at 45 to 63 mm (1.8 to 2.5 in).   ,1
4780,"Voous claimed a mean weight of 474 g (1.045 lb) for males and 583 g (1.285 lb), which would render them 70% more massive than an average long-eared owl (Asio otus) and 60% more massive than an average western barn owl (Tyto alba) despite these species' similar appearance by size.   ",1
4781,"In Denmark, males and females were found to vary in weight from 392 to 692 g (0.864 to 1.526 lb), with an average weight across seasons was 490 g (1.08 lb) for both sexes, or 440 g ",0
4782,(16 oz) for males and 539.7 g (1.190 lb) for females. ,0
4783,"In Danish owls, weights were lowest during brooding and fledgling stages and highest in winter, varying up to 12% and 10%, respectively, in males and females.  ",1
4784,"Weight fluctuations by season were even more pronounced in France, where the mean weights of males and females in winter and late spring differed by 17% in males and nearly 20% in females.  ",1
4785,"In southern Finland body mass were studied instead by age, with the division of 3 years considered for 172 females and 135 males. ",0
4786,"In the males, weight was nearly the same across the age divide, being 481.6 g (1.062 lb) in the younger males and 480.2 g (1.059 lb) in the older ones, however older females were notably larger than young ones, with the younger females averaging 689.1 g (1.519 lb) and older ones averaging 731.6 g (1.613 lb). ",0
4787,"Older females in the Finnish study were found on average to also breed earlier, be more productive and adapt better to varying prey conditions.  ",1
4788,"In England and Scotland, the weights of freshly dead owls was studied against live ones weighed in the wild, with 79 dead females averaging 484.5 g (1.068 lb) against an average of 533 g (1.175 lb) for 22 live females. ",0
4789,"Meanwhile, in males 384.1 g (13.55 oz) was found to be the average for 63 dead individuals, while 20 live ones averaged 408.6 g (14.41 oz). ",0
4790,It was found in English and Scottish tawny owls that the weight down to which males and females could survive starvation could go as low as 325 g (11.5 oz) in males and 390 g (14 oz) in females.  ,1
4791,"In Spain, the average weight of  16 males was 406.2 g (14.33 oz) and for 19 females was 460 g (1.01 lb).  ",1
4792,"In total, weight can vary from 304 to 800 g (0.670 to 1.764 lb) in full grown tawny owls.   ",1
4793,"Hearing is important for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. ",0
4794,"A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences in the time of arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. ",0
4795,"The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below.  ",1
4796,"While the species does show the typical ear asymmetry of an owl and the right ear is consistently larger, the average differences of 7-13% are relatively modest for an owl.   ",1
4797,"Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).  ",1
4798,The ear slits average reportedly 21 to 23 mm (0.83 to 0.91 in) on the left and 22.5 to 26 mm (0.89 to 1.02 in) on the right.   ,1
4799,The movable pre-aural skin flap on tawny owl averages 9.5 mm (0.37 in) on the left and 10.5 mm (0.41 in) on the right.   ,1
4800,The tawny owls has a comparable ear morphology to the Ural owl (Strix uralensis). ,0
4801,"They tend to have a less complicated ear structure than those of Asio species but a more complicated, well-developed and relatively larger ear structure than those of other large generas of typical owl like the Bubo genus or Otus genus.    ",1
4802,"The internal structure of the ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation.  ",1
4803,"The tawny owl's hearing may be ten times better than a human's,  and it can hunt using this sense alone in the dark of a woodland on an overcast night. ",1
4804,"However, the patter of raindrops can make it likely difficult for these owls to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather, especially the crashing din of heavy rain, can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.   ",1
4805,The tawny's range is estimated to average 0.4-0.7 kHz with a maximum of around 3 kHz.   ,1
4806,"The maximum range, in comparison, is up to 6 kHz in the long-eared owl and to 1 kHz in the eagle owl.   ",1
4807,"Advertising calls and most threat and supplanting calls are mostly by males while both sexes may engage in contact calls and alarm calls.  Autumn boundary disputes may occur with excited varied wails and screams between hoots (or ""caterwauling"").  ",1
4808,"The male has a quavering advertising song hoo ho, ho, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo or whooooh uk whooooook. ",0
4809,"It is described as ""a clear, fluted, long-drawn hoot with a wailing quality"".  ",1
4810,"Broken down, the male's song is considered as about three notes drawn together into one, often with an upward inflection and emphasis on the middle note, followed after a brief pause followed by a very short ho, uk or hu and continuing after a further short interval with a long tremolo of staccato notes, often rising or falling slightly in pitch and drawn out in the end. ",0
4811,"On average, the male's song is about 17 seconds in duration.    ",1
4812,"The song may carry up to 1.5 to 2 km (0.93 to 1.24 mi) to human perception.  More than 99% of the time, it was found that individual males could be distinguished via spectrogram in Italy.  ",1
4813,"A female territorial call is somewhat like the male's but is hoarser, less clear and somewhat higher in pitch, transcribed as cher oooOOooo followed by chro cher-oooOOooo cooEEooooo.   ",1
4814,"William Shakespeare used this owl's calls in Love's Labour's Lost (Act 5, Scene 2) as ""Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot"", but this stereotypical call is actually a duet, with the female making the kew-wick contact call.   ",1
4815,"The male's response to the females kewick contact call is more varied, sometimes muffled and fluting notes, sometimes wavering or crooning notes and sometimes a more dissimilar hissing chruuuuuu.    Recordings of various calls may also be an effective way for researchers to study territories and owl responsiveness. ",1
4816,"English male tawny owls were responsive both male and female calls, the latter perhaps due to an interest for mates, while females usually only responded to recordings of female calls.  ",1
4817,Song posts are often only 250 to 300 m (820 to 980 ft) from their roost sites.   ,1
4818,"In an Italian study, 12 males responded much more strongly to recordings of ""stranger"" male tawnys than to recordings of neighboring male owls known to them, in some cases coming to physically attack the recorder when the ""stranger"" call was playing.  ",1
4819,"A study within Spain recording only spontaneous vocalizations that only a low percentage of territories could be detected this way, about 12%, and that males spontaneously called about 2 to 4 times more frequently than females.  ",1
4820,A male's response to a broadcast song appears to be indicative of his health and vigour; owls with higher blood parasite loads use fewer high frequencies and a more limited range of frequencies in their responses to an apparent intruder.  ,1
4821,"In Italy, males hooted more emphatically when the female was in the vicinity.  ",1
4822,"The vocal activity of tawny owls depends on sex, annual cycle stage and weather, with males being more vocal than females year-round, with peak vocal activity during courtship, late winter to early spring, and post-breeding in early autumn, the two times of year when territories are most hotly contested. ",0
4823,"The least frequent vocalizing as a whole being is in DecemberâFebruary and during mid-May to early September, but most especially June to July.   ",1
4824,"Males in particular may call even at the quietest times of year, i.e. usually when he is presumably excited or irritated.   Female territorial hooting is almost entirely confined to autumn.  ",1
4825,"In Italy, females were more aggressive on average than males in response to playback despite lower response levels and exhibited much higher aggression when both members of the pair were present.  ",1
4826,"A correlation was also made in the amount of singing relative to habitat, with owls with territories in farmland responding more vigorously to imitated calls than those in woodland.   ",1
4827,"More moonlit nights showed more aggressive vocal displays in Pavia, Italy despite other seasonal and temporal factors seeming to play no role.  ",1
4828,"In France, studied tawny owls vocalized significantly less during rainy nights, with a very strong 8 fold difference in discrimination threshold (carrying 614 to 74 m (2,014 to 243 ft)) and 69 fold difference in audible broadcast area (118.4 to 1.7 ha (292.6 to 4.2 acres)) in dry against rainy weather.  ",1
4829,"In 50 British tawny owls that were studied in terms of singing duration and quality no correlation was made between breeding success and amount of singing, though larger males sang less but with more emphasis on the last note while those with more evidence of parasites sang more on average.  ",1
4830,"A study of the two main European races, one based in Italy (S. a. aluco) and one in England (S. a. sylvatica), showed the primary song of the male differed significantly in five of the 13 parameters considered, duration of the second note, lowest frequency of the first note, and frequency modulation amplitude being the most important variables and the two races could be aurally discriminated with a high success rate (86.7%). ",0
4831,"A patchwork pattern of possibly culturally transmitted hoot variations was therefore recognized, which may indicate tawny owls have dialects.  ",1
4832,"The calls of the subspecies in southeastern Europe and the Caucasus (S. a. willkonskii) similarly differed in half of  the six parameters considered from the nominate subspecies, with the singing having an overall lower tone in keeping with the race's slightly larger size.  ",1
4833,"Further described calls by tawny owls include piercing coo-wik or cu-weeehl cries, apparently expressing aggression. ",0
4834,"When disturbed at the nest, these owls may utter a series of yelping uett-uett-uett.. notes.  ",1
4835,"Boundary disputes frequently cause males to utter a wett wett, weck weck weck or gweck gweck gweck call, while females do a significantly less deep-sounding version of this. ",0
4836,Females may also engage in a similar vocalization before launching a protective attack against predators.  ,1
4837,"A further bubbling call, uttered by both sexes, the males' version being softer and lower, the females being harsher, liken to human uttering ooo sound while moving tongue back and forth, due to the soft rolling sound, but also has been compared to the drumming sound of a common snipe (Gallinago gallinago). ",0
4838,"Although fairly frequent during high intensity pair interactions (such as during nest inspections), the bubbling call is difficult to detect except at close range so is probably underreported.    A pig-like grunting has sometimes been reported as emitted by males during courtship displays.  ",1
4839,"Leading up to food deliveries by the male, the female may utter a food excitement call, kiv-kiv-kiv-kiv , culminating in a peeping whistling sii-sii-si-siiiii as she receives prey.  ",1
4840,"Other calls uttered by females witt-witt (before copulation) and rapid kikikikiiii (during copulation), both of which may be the same call, while a high-pitched, trilling sound similar to European green toad (Bufo virdis), sometimes transcribed as lee-lee-lee, is uttered by the female in similar contexts.    ",1
4841,The female may call hung-hung or ung-ung-ung-haug-haug when comforting their nestlings or trying to get reluctant young to eat.   ,1
4842,"A distraction display call may be engaged in by either parent, wavering iiiii or keeee, similar to the chipping of a passerine, has been described as ""unsteady flute-like piping of despair"".  ",1
4843,"Males may utter a chochochocho, apparently to express gentleness when in close quarters with its mate.   ",1
4844,"A mysterious call described as the long call is of unknown meaning, long call, consisting of a moaning, elongated note of unknown meaning, often isolated from any other kind of vocalization and reminiscent of the mewing of a herring gull (Larus argentatus), keeeee keeuuuh keeuhkuhkuh.  ",1
4845,"Other mysterious calls recorded for tawny owls have included tooting, chittering, crowing, screeching or mewing, as well as soft, plaintive squeaks by females.  ",1
4846,"The young owls in nest beg for food with a drawn-out cheek or cheheee, sziii-szi, psji-ii or tsjuk.   ",1
4847,"Delicate, piping pipipipi calls may uttered by nestlings in discomfort (often recorded when the mother interrupts brooding).  From when they can actively feed themselves to when they are fledged, the young draw out their call to a wheezy, louder and more boisterous tsi-weep, being less highed and squeaky than the begging call of the long-eared owl.  ",1
4848,"By the first year, the young tawny owls have an adult voice but it is usually slightly higher pitched.  ",1
4849,"An owl's eyes are placed at the front of the head and have a field overlap of 50â70%, giving it better binocular vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30â50%).   ",1
4850,"The diameter of the eye reaches about 16 to 23 mm (0.63 to 0.91 in), against 11 mm (0.43 in) in the long-eared owl, while the tawny's axial length reaches 29 to 35.7 mm (1.14 to 1.41 in).   ",1
4851,"The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36 million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed,  it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. ",1
4852,"However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10.  ",1
4853,"The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.     ",1
4854,"In addition to middling visual acuity relative to other vertebrates, the colour discrimination in the vision of this owl may be limited.   Adaptations to night vision include the large size of the eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have superior light sensitivity. ",1
4855,"There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity.  ",1
4856,"Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime and dusk hunters like the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus).  ",1
4857,"When compared to a diurnal bird like a rock dove (Columba livia), the tawny owl's ability to navigate at night does not appear to lie in its light gather power or number of rod receptors but instead is due to the differences in the retinal neural integration mechanisms which is only possible due to the absolutely large size of the rental image only because of its absolutely large sized retinal image.   ",1
4858,"It was hypothesized that the tawny owls ability to navigate their surroundings may be correlated in part due to familiarity with the environment of their territory.  Generally speaking, the tawny owl is unlikely to be mistaken for other owls.  ",1
4859,"Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; other Strix and eagle-owls can be somewhat similar in shape, but are much larger.  ",1
4860,"Despite two other European species being included in the Strix genus, the tawny is rather distinct from the others.  ",1
4861,"The Ural owl is notably larger with proportionately smaller dark brown eyes, a proportionately smaller head and the underparts are streaked without crossbars. ",0
4862,"Furthermore, Ural owls have a proportionately longer and more distinctly barred tail.    ",1
4863,"The great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) is much larger than a tawny owl with a huge head, a proportionately longer tail, a more uniform dark-greyish plumage, a darker facial disc with distinct concentric lines and relatively smaller yellow eyes.  ",1
4864,"The desert or Hume's owls (Strix hadorami) (as well as its sister species, the Omani owl (Strix butleri)) are almost entirely allopatric in distribution from tawny owls. ",0
4865,"Both species range into some mutual areas, such as the northern Middle East including Israel but almost always in different areas and habitats. ",0
4866,The Hume's owl is smaller than the tawny owl and more sandy-colored with orange-yellow to pale ochraceous-orange eyes.   ,1
4867,"Among owls of the Asio genus, all species are smaller to a certain degree and quite different looking. ",0
4868,All Asio species also prefer more open habitats than tawny owls as well.   ,1
4869,Marsh owl (Asio capensis) which overlaps scarcely in Northwestern Africa has smaller ear tufts and is rather uniform earthen-brown above with pale facial disc. ,0
4870,"Short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) has smaller ear tufts, yellow eyes and streaked underparts. ",0
4871,"The long-eared owl (Asio otus) is slighter in build and weight than a tawny owl with prominent ear tufts, orange eyes and different plumage patterning.    ",1
4872,All eagle-owls and fish-owls are much larger than tawny owls with prominent ear tufts and distinct plumages.  ,1
4873,The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae under its current scientific name.  ,1
4874,"The binomial derives from Greek strix ""owl"" and Italian allocco, ""tawny owl"" (from Latin ulucus ",0
4875,"Some early descriptions upon review were found to have somehow conflated the very different barn owl with the scientific name Strix aluco, which in turn engendered some confusion.  ",1
4876,"The tawny owl is a member of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which contains all species of owl other than the barn owls. ",0
4877,"Conservatively, about 18 species are currently represented in this Strix genus, typically being medium to large sized owls, characteristically round-headed and lacking ear tufts, which acclimate to living in forested parts of various climatic zones.   ",1
4878,"Four owls native to the neotropics are sometimes additionally included with the Strix genus though some authors include these in a separate but related genus, Ciccaba.   ",1
4879,"The tawny owl is smallish for a Strix species, the smallest of the circumpolar species, mildly larger than the species from the neotropics and tropical species from Africa and the Middle East, and slightly to considerably smaller than the Asian tropical species.   ",1
4880,Strix owls have an extensive fossil record and have long been widely distributed.  ,1
4881,"The genetic relationship of true owls is somewhat muddled and different genetic testings has variously indicated that Strix owls are related to disparate appearing genera like Pulsatrix, Bubo and Asio.     ",1
4882,"Tropical species, such as the mottled owl (Strix virgata) and the African wood owl (Strix woodfordii), the latter once considered a close relative to the tawny owl, morphological differ from and have smaller outer ear areas than tawny owls.   ",1
4883,The tawny owl is thought to be a close relative of the Ural owl. ,0
4884,"Authors have hypothesized that the origin of the two species divided following Pleistocene continental glaciations segregated a southwest or southern group in temperate forest (i.e. the tawny) from an eastern one inhabiting cold, boreal ranges (i.e. the Ural). ",0
4885,"After retreat of the continental ice masses, the ranges more recently penetrated each other.    ",1
4886,"While the life history details of the tawny and Ural owls are largely corresponding, nonetheless the species have a number of morphological differences and are largely adapted to different climates, times of activity and habitats.   ",1
4887,"Based on Strix fossil species from Middle Pleistocene (given the name Strix intermedia) in variously the Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary show from leg and wing bones indicate an owl of intermediate form and size between Ural and tawny owls.     ",1
4888,"However, fossils of a larger and differently proportioned Strix owl than a tawny owl, identified as Strix brevis, from Germany and Hungary from before the Pleistocene (i.e. Piacenzian) suggest a more complicated evolutionary and distributional history.      ",1
4889,"A hybrid was recorded in captivity between a male Ural and a female tawny owl, which managed to produce two offspring that were intermediate in size and had a more complex song that was also shared some characteristics with both species' vocalizations.  ",1
4890,A number of owls that were considered conspecific with the tawny owl are now widely considered to be separate species via conclusive genetic studies. ,0
4891,"These consist of the desert or Hume's owl and its sister species, the recently separated and range-restricted Omani owl.    ",1
4892,Another species even more recently found to be distinct from tawny owls is the little-known Himalayan owl (Strix nivicolum).   ,1
4893,"Yet another former subspecies, the Maghreb owl (Strix mauritanica), was recently split from this species on the grounds of genetics via phylogeography, with this subdesert owl differing from the tawny in its cooler colour tone and differing calls.  ",1
4894,"In all four separated species there is no evidence that the tawny owl breeds in the same areas as them, making each species allopatric, though the desert and tawny's range nearly abuts in some parts of the Middle East such as northern Israel.   ",1
4895,"Also, in the Western Himalayas both the tawny and Himalayan owls are known to occur but there is likely a gap of several hundred kilometers in distribution with tawny mostly restricted to the Pakistani side while the Himalayan is rarely found west of Himachal Pradesh.    ",1
4896,"Furthermore, the desert and Omani species pair and the Himalayan species are considerably different based on superficial appearance (far more so than true tawny owl subspecies), have distinct voices and appear to have slightly different nesting habits than tawny owls.  ",1
4897,"The tawny owl subspecies are often poorly differentiated, and may be at a flexible stage of subspecies formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour tone of the local habitat, and the size of available prey. ",0
4898,"Consequently, various authors have historically described between 10 and 15 subspecies.  ",1
4899,The total number of subspecies was once considered as totaling at 11 subspecies but is now reduced due to the separation of the Himalayan owl and its own further two subspecies down to about eight subspecies.    ,1
4900,"This species is found through much of Iberian Peninsula, though spotty distribution here, with the largest gap where absent being in southeastern Spain (where still not completely absent).   ",1
4901,"The tawny owl is also found throughout England and Scotland, but is not present in some of less well wooded areas of northern Scotland.  ",1
4902,"Their range is almost continuously from throughout France to eastern Europe within mainland Europe and continuously from Estonia, Latvia and Denmark in the north down through most of Italy (including northern Sicily).     ",1
4903,"Tawny owls may be absent to rare in some swaths of southeastern Europe such as smallish parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, central Bulgaria and southern Romania where the habitat probably becomes too mountainous and is similarly absent in the mountainous parts of Switzerland and northernmost Italy. ",0
4904,"In Scandinavia, the tawny owl ranges through much of southern and central Norway (where they probably reach their northern limit as a species in central Nordland), southern Sweden (up to Dalarna and southeastern Norrland) and southern Finland (jogging up slightly farther north along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia).   ",1
4905,"Their occurrence in Finland is quite recent, with the species estimated to have colonized the country independently around the year 1878, and, possibly in sync with warming temperatures, tawny owls have expanded their range in other relatively northern countries like Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.   ",1
4906,The tawny owl is considered a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.  ,1
4907,"Also, the tawny owl ranges throughout coastal (to the coast of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea) and central Turkey, most of Georgia and Azerbaijan, Lebanon, far western Syria, northernmost Israel, northeastern Jordan, northern and southeastern Iraq and western, northern and central Iran.    ",1
4908,"After a wide gap of distribution, the range reassumes in central and eastern Uzbekistan, southern Kazakhstan, northern Tajikistan, northern Kyrgyzstan and northeasternmost China (i.e. the area once consider Turkestan). ",0
4909,"After another gap, the range resumes in northeasternmost Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, eastern Tajikistan and north India (mostly western Jammu and Kashmir).     ",1
4910,"The tawny owl is also distributed in a large portion of Russia, though mainly the southwestern part, ranging up as far north up to about the city of Petrozavodsk in the west, Lake Tolvayarvi and Kama River in the central part with the range stopping at roughly the Irtysh river in western Siberia thence more or less continuously from there down into northwestern Kazakhstan.   ",1
4911,Records of the species expanding their range along the Irtysh and far the west up into Karelia may show that the species is expanding its range north much as it is in Europe.  ,1
4912,The preferred habitat of the tawny owl is temperate deciduous forest and mixed forest with some access to clearings. ,0
4913,"They too may habituate to riverine forests, parks, large gardens with old trees, open landscapes with wooded patches and avenues of trees in open agriculture.  ",1
4914,"The species prefers ""richly structured habitat"" with old, mature trees available.  ",1
4915,"Since they naturally tend to utilize tree hollows as nesting sites, sections of forest or woods with available snags may be ideal.  ",1
4916,They tend to occupy pure coniferous forest only near edges or when clearings and glades exist. ,0
4917,"Often areas in the conifer forest, especially the taiga in the north, where the tawnys will occur show a mixture of some deciduous tree growth such as birches and poplars.  ",1
4918,"In the taiga-dominant environments of vast Russia, tawny owls are usually restricted to broadleaf stands often in river drainages, parks, orchards and cultivated lands, often where woods of Quercus, Tilia and Betula stand with plentiful broken snags and dead trees.  ",1
4919,"Locally, the tawny owl has been known to be adaptive to subalpine forest dominated by conifers, such as the pine forests in the Spanish ranges of Sierra de Gredos and Sierra de Guadarrama.  ",1
4920,"Similarly, in southern Poland, they reported occur in spruce-fir dominated forests.  ",1
4921,Also the species can habituate to rocky areas as long as they have scattered trees and bushes from which to execute hunting.  ,1
4922,"Locally, tawny owls are quite adaptive to living near or in human settlements, extending to towns or cities, most often within timbered gardens or tree-line pavement areas. ",0
4923,"They have adapted to living in parks or wooded suburban fringes of almost every major European city, including London and Berlin.   ",1
4924,"They also live in and around even larger cities just outside of Europe, such as Istanbul and Moscow.   ",1
4925,"Although tawny owls occur in urban environments, they are less likely to occur at sites with high noise levels at night.  ",1
4926,"While this owl can settle in very young forest as long as nest boxes are available, woods with trees too young to support typical hunting behaviours from a prominent perch may be suboptimal.  ",1
4927,"In Lithuania, it was found that nest boxes would booster the population in openings of the forest, interiors of mature forest and even grassland but no increase was noted in young forest in a state of recovery.  ",1
4928,"In the well-studied population of Monks Wood, England, those living in more continuous sections of the woods (stands exceeding 4 ha (9.9 acres)) had more territorial skirmishes and overlapping territories while within farmland parts would be clustered around available wooded stands. ",0
4929,"In the Monks Woods, intermediate woods were probably preferable with less direct competition and more food was likely.   ",1
4930,"In a Romanian study, tawny owls were rare in glades within the forest where substantial gaps occurred and were clustered around very old stands of trees, possibly being restricted from the more prey-rich glades by interspecific competition.  ",1
4931,"In central Italy, 560 territories were studied in various habitats such as urban parks, mesophilic woods, sclerophyllous woods, and mountainous beech woods, with the most attractive and highest density type being in sclerophyllous woods and lowest in urban woods and mountainous beech.  ",1
4932,"Generally, tawny owls occur in lowland areas but also may occur in mountainous areas (i.e. not exceeding 550 m (1,800 ft) in Scotland).  ",1
4933,"They generally do not exceed 1,600 to 1,800 m (5,200 to 5,900 ft) above sea level in the Alps but may live at up to 2,650 m (8,690 ft) on Piz Lagrev in Switzerland.   ",1
4934,"Tawny owls may live at elevations of over 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in parts of Armenia, Turkey and Tien Shen.  ",1
4935,"The species may even occur at elevations of up to 4,200 m (13,800 ft) in the Himalayas.  ",1
4936,"The tawny owl is generally quite nocturnal, but are sometimes briefly active during daylight. ",0
4937,This is usually the case when young have to be fed and male owls may need to be active continuously for up to 11 hours in order to obtain enough prey.   ,1
4938,"In a probably exceptional event, some tawny owls were observed to mix with a flock of black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) in extracting earthworms on a plowed field in England in broad daylight.  Of the three European owls in the Strix genus, the tawny is by far the least prone to be active during daylight.  Nocturnal activity by tawny owls starts on average 18â22 minutes earlier and ends on average 10 minutes later than that of nearby long-eared owls.  Radio study in Monks Woods, revealed that upon nightfall, males nesting in continuous woodland spent 40% less time flying, covering an average distance of 74.9 m (246 ft) per hour, than those nesting in farmland, which covered an average of 148 m (486 ft) per hour. ",1
4939,"These owls may roost by day amongst dense foliage, quite often on a branch close to the trunk, or in a natural hole in a tree or rock formation, in a hole or crevice of a wall.  ",1
4940,"They at times will make use of manmade perches in suburban areas, such as utility poles, peaked roofs, chimney pots, tall fences, billboards or television antenna by dusk, while during the day they often tuck away in hollies, evergreens, oaks and/or thick ivy.   ",1
4941,"On occasion, they may found roosting even in the attics of large buildings, barns or sheds, inside church towers or the chimneys of houses.  One may be able to locate tawny owls by looking for whitewash but, unlike long-eared owls, tawny owls changes perch sites with some regularity so they tend to be less detectable overall.  Often finding tawny owls during daylight is done by listening for noisy mobbing of a discovered owl by other birds, especially by large and/or bold passerines, or by squirrels during the day. ",1
4942,"Usually, the often fairly drowsy owls are unable to counterattack or kill their wary tormentors and may at times depart and try to seek out another roost.   A radiotelemetry study of 22 owls in Denmark researched the effect perch use has in mitigating potential mobbings or predation acts. ",1
4943,"It was found that juveniles were more likely to use to secluded, hidden roosts whereas adults with hatched young through independent young were more likely to perch in the open apparently to protect their offspring. ",0
4944,Adults were more likely to perch in open and closer to the ground when prey supplies were lower than were they were not.  ,1
4945,"Though this is generally a quite cold-hardy species, a study near the northern limits of the species range in central Norway showed that due to thermoregulation that the owls locally had to compensate for the climate by conserving energy via incremental feeding activity.  ",1
4946,The tawny owl is a highly territorial owl that seldom leaves its home range. ,0
4947,Tawny owls maintain territories through the signature male and female hooting songs.  ,1
4948,"Although they tend to most vigorously defend their territories in autumn, when year-old birds may try to supplant either member of a pair (though often unsuccessfully), and least so when actively incubating and brooding in spring and early summer, these owls can easily be provoked to defend their territory at any time of the year.     ",1
4949,"Not infrequently, territorial fights become heated, potentially drawing all members of two pairs and/or escalating into a potentially fatal physical confrontations, and may be embellished with bill-snapping and wing raising.    ",1
4950,"During male territorial displays, after giving chase, the initial male is often chased right back, occasionally seesawing as such multiple times, occasionally hitting branches or wrestling one another to the ground.   ",1
4951,Occasional fights with long-eared owls along territorial edges are recorded too.  ,1
4952,"In SeptemberâDecember in Wytham Woods, 0.42 boundary disputes were recorded per hour in woods and 0.14 per hour at night in farmland, most occurred when pairs were within 3 m (9.8 ft) of each other.  Territories tend to be markedly stable over time, in some pairs at Wytham Woods, territorial lines have been roughly the same over a 2 decade period.  ",1
4953,Single pairs have been known maintained territories for up to 10 years in Russia and even up to 13 year in the Berlin area.   ,1
4954,"In Gribskov, Denmark, the overlapping mutual range of both members of a pair averaged 82% in summer and 56% in winter, while on average 9% of the home range overlapped with neighboring pairs.[143 ",0
4955,"] Habitat appears to be key in territory size, i.e. in English farmland (Warwickshire) (10) territories were inversely related to the amount of closed woodland they contained, whereas in fragmented woodland (Cambridgeshire) (23) territories were dependent strongly on the size of ""core"" woodland with owls in smaller or more isolated stands having larger territories.  ",1
4956,"In Wytham Woods, territories average around 7.3 ha (18 acres) on sparse limestone ground, but are 13.8 ha (34 acres) on average where dense ground cover grows over clay earth.  ",1
4957,"Subsequently, in British deciduous forests it was estimated that the average territory would be around 18.2 ha (45 acres) in deciduous woods, 37.4 ha (92 acres) in mixed farmland and 46.1 ha (114 acres) in spruce stands.   ",1
4958,"In farmland areas of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the defended border of the territory was up to 3 km (1.9 mi), with 17-40% of the territories were used exclusively for hunting.  Spanish studies, in Bizkaia, show a fairly low density of around 0.72 territories per square kilometer for 1704 occupied territories found in area of 2,348 km2 (907 sq mi).  ",1
4959,"Lower still densities were found in Murcia far to the south in Spain, where the tawny owls must nest on rock formations, with 17 territories were found per 100 km2 (39 sq mi).  ",1
4960,"In Central Europe, in prime areas, territories are often about 25 to 35 ha (62 to 86 acres), seldom to 50 ha (120 acres), and have a defended boundary of about 2 to 3 km (1.2 to 1.9 mi).  ",1
4961,Study blocks of western Germany held 42 territories on 50 km2 (19 sq mi) and 21 territories in 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi).  ,1
4962,"Elsewhere in central Europe, in KozÅowiecki forest of Poland, pair occupancy increased from 2.4 to 4.6 per 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) between 1991 and 2006, due to conserving of forest, i.e. trees with cavities, and increasingly mild weather.  ",1
4963,"The Polish city of Warsaw was found to hold 1.2-1.6 pairs per 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) in the city and 0.8-1 pairs per 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) in the general area, with 40-60 pairs found in Warsaw metropolitan.  ",1
4964,"In the Polish area of Lubin, territory sizes averaged 18.8 ha (46 acres) with much variation based on pair density and season, with the smallest territories down to 10.8 ha (27 acres) in summer and the largest in autumn at 30.9 ha (76 acres).  ",1
4965,"In the city centre of Pavia in Italy, the average number of pairs per square kilometer was 0.9-1.1 or an average territory size of 17.9 ha (44 acres), while in the rural areas nearby the average territory size was 22 ha (54 acres). ",0
4966,"In a study of 586 territories on 22 study plots in central Italy, average territory size in peak thermophilous woods was 7.1 ha (18 acres) while other woodland types from urban parks to montane beech habitats ranged in average size from 10.8 to 22.4 ha (27 to 55 acres).   Territory size varied in the area of Rome by habitat, with wooded city parks, with 3.3 territories per square kilometer, and well-wooded suburbs, with 5.7 territories per square kilometer, holding peak numbers among the habitat types and having an average territory size of 17.6 ha (43 acres), while developed areas of the city, rural areas and farmland (where average territory was 183.4 ha (453 acres)) all held considerably lower densities of territories.   ",1
4967,A few recorded territories in Denmark were found to be 27 to 50 ha (67 to 124 acres) in size.   ,1
4968,"In Montenegro's montane Bjelasica area, 6.1 territories were registered per 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi).  ",1
4969,"In Moldova, the average density of territories was 8.3 per 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi).  ",1
4970,"In Sweden, larger territories are necessary, i.e. 2 mature females over 89 and 146 ha (220 and 360 acres).  ",1
4971,A similarly very large range was reported for tawny owls in the Trondheim area of Norway.  ,1
4972,"The tawny owl is a not a migratory bird and adults tend to be highly residential, maintaining their home range and territory throughout the year. ",0
4973,"However, juvenile dispersal can occur over dozens to rarely hundreds of kilometres.  In southern Finland, juveniles rarely move more than 100 km (62 mi) away from their nest of origin, doing so in multidirectional movements.   ",1
4974,"In Sweden, most movements by juveniles are to less than 50 km (31 mi) away from their nest of origin, rarely more so. ",0
4975,Exceptionally a juvenile tawny was recorded to cover 745 km (463 mi) northwesterly from VaÌstergoÌtland to VaÌsterbotten.  ,1
4976,The record movement recorded for a tawny owl from Scandinavia (or possibly from anywhere) apparently is 745 km (463 mi).  ,1
4977,"Further south in Europe, long-distance movements tend to be much rarer, and perhaps such movements are rarer than any other owl.   ",1
4978,Rare records show movements of up to 270 to 450 km (170 to 280 mi) movements from the northern reaches of central Europe.   ,1
4979,"Peak hunting activity tends to occur largely between dusk to midnight, with owls often following an erratic hunting pattern, perhaps to sites where previous hunts were successful.   ",1
4980,"When feeding young, hunting may need to be prolonged into daylight in the early morning.    ",1
4981,"Based on hand-reared young owls that re-released into the wild, hunting behaviour is quite innate rather than learned.  ",1
4982,Perching bouts usually last from about 8 to 14 minutes depending largely on habitat.  Tawny owl's hunting from a perch or pole can recall a buzzard and the two take similar prey sizes as well. ,1
4983,"However, high initial speed and maneuvering among trees and bushes with great dexterity may allow it to surprise relatively large prey, more like a goshawk.  ",1
4984,The tawny owl is capable of lifting and carrying off in flight individual prey weighing up to at least 320 g ,0
4985,"Their middle talon, the most enlarged claw on owls, measures an average of 19.1 mm (0.75 in). ",0
4986,"While not as large as those of the Ural owl, the talons are extremely sharp, stout and quite decurved. ",0
4987,"The claws are considered to be visibly more overdeveloped than those of other European mid-sized owls and the footspan including the claws is fairly larger as well, at an average of about 13.4 cm (5.3 in).    ",1
4988,The hunting owl often extends its wings to balance and control prey upon impact.  ,1
4989,"This occurs from 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft) over the ground, often over open habitats such as bushes, marsh or grassland, forming a quartering or zigzag pattern over the opening. ",0
4990,During these flights they cover about 30 to 50 m (98 to 164 ft) before changing direction.[168 ,0
4991,"] Hunting from flight was surprisingly prevalent in a Swedish study of two radio-tagged birds, with 34% of study time spent hunting from flight while 40% of the study time was spent on hunting from a perch.  ",1
4992,"In a similar study in England, less than 1% of time was spent hunting from flight.  ",1
4993,"In a more deliberate variation of hunting from flight, the hunting owl may examine crags and nest boxes or also hover around prey roosts. ",0
4994,"In the latter type of hunts, the tawny owls may strike branches and/or beat their wings together in front of denser foliage, bushes or conifers in order to disturb and flush prey such as small birds and bats, or may dive directly into said foliage.     ",1
4995,"Hovering has also been recorded in differing circumstances, including one incidence of an owl hunting a small bird that was caught on the wing after a hovering flight.   Tawny owls have also taken bats on the wing as well (such as ones snatched from near streep lamps when attempting to hunt themselves) and have been seen to hawk large, relatively slow-flying insects such as some beetles and moths in flight. [169 ",1
4996,Usually these hunting variations are correlated with poor weather hampering the capture of preferred prey.   ,1
4997,"Tawny owls eat worms with relative frequency, as they often hear them apparently from below the surface and snatch them up from shallow dirt or below leaf litter. ",0
4998,Their worm-hunting style recalls worm hunting techniques by most other birds and they were recorded to eat 0.39 worms per minute during an hour of observation in England and were sometimes seen to feed on worms during daylight.     ,1
4999,"Other hunting from the ground has been observed, often of insects such as beetles, but tawny owls have also been reported to ""leap"" upon from a ground vantage point in order to capture a vole, quite like foxes often do.    ",1
5000,"There are now many accounts of tawny owls feeding on carrion from a wide range of sources, including hares, rats, sheep, and trout.     Upon capture, small prey like shrews and rodents are often swallowed whole, while others may be torn into pieces. ",1
5001,"Often prey is dismembered in order to more easily ingest it whole, i.e. decapitating mice, removing the legs from frogs while birds like sparrows are also regularly decapitated (with the head often eaten separately) and nearly all avian prey is plucked before being consumed.     ",1
5002,"One tawny owl was observed to eat a squirrel by leaving the head intact and peeling the skin back from the neck, apparently leaving bones in place while consuming the flesh.  Indigestible items, including fur, feathers, bones (which sometimes visibly protrude out of the peller), sometimes intestines and invertebrate carapaces, are regurgitated in large pellets, that can be anywhere in typical size from 20.3 to 67 mm (0.80 to 2.64 in) long with a diameter of 17 to 30 mm (0.67 to 1.18 in). ",1
5003,The pellets are typically grey coloured and are found in groups under trees used for roosting or nesting. ,0
5004,At least some tawny owl pellets can measure up to 84 mm (3.3 in) long and can include large objects such as an intact 10 cm (3.9 in) bill of a snipe.     ,1
5005,"Undigested material coughed up often reveals different prey than pellets.  Estimated daily food requirements for a tawny owl is 73.5 g (2.59 oz), which is proportionately lower (at about 14% of their own body mass) than the estimates for other medium-sized owls in Europe (at 23-26% of their own body mass), therefore tawny owls can appear to live off of relatively little food quite efficiently.  ",1
5006,The tawny owl takes an extremely wide range of prey species. ,0
5007,The global prey spectrum for tawny owls includes well over 400 prey species.    ,1
5008,"They generally prefer small mammals in their diet, especially various species of rodent, where they are available.  ",1
5009,"However, they are one are the least specialized owls in Europe when it comes to prey selection and can broadly be described as extremely opportunistic.   ",1
5010,"Tawny owls respond to access of prey concentrations of virtually any variety, including birds, amphibians and insects as well as sometimes reptiles and fish, by taking them in large numbers, sometimes equal or even (more infrequently) greater numbers than mammalian prey.    ",1
5011,The difference between the generalist tawny owl and a specialized rodent-hunter like the long-eared owl was illustrated in a semi-captive experience where the two owl species were exposed to different classes of wild prey as they encountered it. ,0
5012,"In this experiment, only small mammals and roosting sparrows were attacked and eaten by both, though flying sparrrows were avoided by long-eared owls and not by the tawnys. ",0
5013,"In the stated study, the tawny owls would kill and eat amphibians and fish, while the long-eared owls would rarely kill and never eat these types of prey.  ",1
5014,"In a study of five European biomes, with about 45 prey species per biome, the tawny owl was estimated to have tied for the second most prey species per biome after the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).  ",1
5015,"Another European study found the mean food niche breadth,  i.e. the estimated average by number of prey species per nest or study site, the tawny owl surpassed all European owls within the two of the three main regions of non-British Europe, with 5.84 mean food niche breadth in central Europe and 4.3 food niche breadth in the Mediterranean region. ",0
5016,"In the latter study, the eagle-owl food niche breadth was listed as 2.4 and 3.3 in these regions, respectively (tawny owls were excluded from analysis in the Scandivanian region due to their marginal range there).  ",1
5017,One estimation of the mean prey size taken in all of Europe for the tawny owl was 34.5 g (1.22 oz). ,0
5018,"In northern and central Europe, older studies place the mean prey size taken as usually between 29 and 40 g (1.0 and 1.4 oz).    ",1
5019,"Another study, of the aforementioned 5 European biomes, showed a drastically lower mean estimated prey size of 18.6 g (0.66 oz), even slightly lower than the mean prey size taken by an owl like the Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), which weighs about one-eighth as much as tawny owl.[191 ",0
5020,] Individual dietary studies show that the mean prey mass taken by tawny owls can vary from 12.6 to 130 g (0.44 to 4.59 oz) depending on prey access.    ,1
5021,"A central Italian study showed how habitat type and resulting prey composition can vary mean prey size considerably, with broadleaf highland forest having a mean prey mass of 26.6 g (0.94 oz), mixed forest having a mean mass of 37.7 g (1.33 oz), urban areas having a mean prey mass of 40.3 g ",0
5022,(1.42 oz) and coppice woodland having a high mean prey mass of 73.1 g ,0
5023,Tawny owls will potentially take any small mammals that they encounter. ,0
5024,This was illustrated in Poland where the number of species taken by the owls was greater than the number of species biologists could capture themselves.  ,1
5025,They primarily take and derive most of their food energy from rodent prey.  ,1
5026,"Dietary staples in much of their range are in particular the long-tailed Apodemus, commonly called field or wood mice, and the short-tailed rodents known as voles. ",0
5027,"Amongst voles, the widely distributed bank vole (Myodes glareolus) tends to be the most favored type over large portions of the range, though different species of the Microtus genus can become locally rather prominent.   Microtus voles tend to forage in more open habitats such as fields than do the wooded edge-favoring bank vole and especially Apodemus mice, and so are usually selected more so where the preferred rodent types are rare or absent.  ",1
5028,"Previous studies claimed that Apodemus mice were preferred where available over bank voles as the latter was considered ""somewhat diurnal"",  however bank voles like many voles are more correctly considered cathemeral, potentially active any time of day or night, and may actually be readily accessible to hunting tawny owls.   ",1
5029,"However, the bank voles favoring of heavier ground cover does limit access to them in the warmer months, whereas Apodemus mice are more likely to continue forage on open ground adjacent to woods and tend to be preferred at this time.  ",1
5030,It was found that bank voles become more vulnerable to tawny owls in areas where enlarged deer herds consume more of the ground cover.  ,1
5031,"A broad study of different nations within central Europe found that Apodemus mice and bank voles could alternately take the primary food mantle, and that the variation of which was favorite was likely due to differing habitat and forest composition characteristics in the given regions.  ",1
5032,"In Finland, bank and Microtus voles were taken more or less in equivalent occurrence to their observed populations in the field.  ",1
5033,"Similarly, in Poland, they took yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) adults roughly in proportion to their occurrence in the wild. ",0
5034,"On the other hand, per the Polish study, juvenile yellow-necks were taken much less and subadults much more than their occurrence in the wild. ",0
5035,"Here, the tawny owls took slightly larger specimens on average than the average recorded in wild, at an estimated mean size taken of 34 g (1.2 oz).  ",1
5036,"In a study from Denmark, yellow-necked mice and bank voles that were caught by tawny owls were disproportionately large, adult males (55% and 73% of the time, respectively).  ",1
5037,"In central Lithuania, tawny and long-eared owls took common voles (Microtus arvalis) than were 24% heavier on average than those encountered in the wild, which averaged 16.45 g (0.580 oz) (thus including younger voles). ",0
5038,"More surprisingly, the long-eared owls were taking voles averaging some 9% larger than those taken by tawny owls.  Wild mice, bank voles and, to a more pronounced extent, Microtus voles undergo population cycles over a three-year (or sometimes four-year) span, which frequently requires the owls to alternate their foods when populations decline.   ",1
5039,This effect was studied in the British Kielder Forest and the nearby Kershope Burn. ,0
5040,"Here tawny owls are exceptionally dependent on field voles (Microtus agretis) as food, constituting about 64.3% of 1220 prey items in the area, but the Kielder forest field vole population had an exceptional four-year drought whereas in the same time frame Kershope kept a more stable owl population seemingly because it retained the typical three-year cycle.   ",1
5041,"In Wytham, Britain, tawnys were thought to remove up to one-third of the local population of bank voles and one-third to three-quarters of the less numerous wood mouse (Apodemus sylvatica).  ",1
5042,"On a 148 ha (370 acres) plot of Wielkopolska, tawny owls are thought to remove an estimated 2,213 rodents annually, or 15 rodents per ha each year, which was about the same rate of loss of striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) per ha in the Warsaw area as well.   ",1
5043,"In BiaÅowiezÌa Forest, tawny owls were estimated to remove in autumn 54% of the yellow-necked mice and 40% of bank voles.  ",1
5044,"In the largest known European diet studies, rodents usually are predominant. ",0
5045,"Amongst 68,070 prey items in Slovakia, the main prey were the yellow-necked mouse (23.8%), the bank vole (9.9%) and the common vole (9.14%).  In the Czech Republic, the same three main prey species led the foods amongst 17,433 prey items, with the yellow-necked at 33.4%, the common vole at 15.7% and the bank vole at 11.2%.  ",1
5046,"Among prey groups in Grunewald, Germany, with 13,359 vertebrate prey items studied, Apodemus species made up 25.7% of the foods and Microtus voles of about four species made up a further 16.7%.  ",1
5047,"The diet differed in the German area of Herrnut, where the common vole was dominant in the foods at 53.3% of 8513 prey items.  ",1
5048,"In a little over half of about 15 smaller prey studies for tawny owls in Poland, mammals led the food composition of owls by number, but in different areas and habitats of the nation, yellow-necked mice, common voles and bank voles could be at the top of the list.    ",1
5049,"Of 43,000 mammal prey items in an older large study of central Europe, 66% were bank or Microtus voles, while a further 24% were Apodemus species.  ",1
5050,"In western Switzerland, the diet was similar but far more homogeneous, with Apodemus species at 74.3% and bank vole at 18.7% among 10,176 prey items.  ",1
5051,"The northernmost food study for tawny owls thus far conducted showed that in Sweden, field voles were the main food amongst 578 prey items, at 30.5%, with bank voles being supplemental at 8.7%. ",0
5052,"However, the second most commonly taken prey in Sweden is the much larger European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), which weighs an estimated mean of 177 g (6.2 oz), and presumably a very nutritious prey resource to these owls.  ",1
5053,"The easternmost food study thus far known was a small one of 201 prey items for the tawny owls in Moscow, wherein the common vole was dominant at 72.6%.  ",1
5054,"Of similar longitude, in the Caucasus, amongst 1236 prey items, the main foods were Ural field mouse (Apodemus uralensis) at 48.1% of the prey composition and edible dormouse (Glis glis) at 15%.  ",1
5055,"The tawny owl takes many species of dormouse, which are nocturnal, largely arboreal and generally rarer within the forests and edges than common mice and vole prey.   ",1
5056,"While many dormice are smallish (roughly vole or mouse sized), the edible species is often more than five times larger, being close in dimensions to the European water vole. ",0
5057,"Therefore, the prey biomass must have been hearty in Montenegro, where the edible dormouse was the main food, at 24.1% of 529 prey items.   ",1
5058,"Other more easterly parts of Europe show relatively high balances of edible dormice as well, such as in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia.   ",1
5059,"Another widely taken species is the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), as well as at least three further species.     Another rodent of special interest due to its natural scarcity and its place in the diet of tawny owls is the northern birch mouse (Sicista betulina), which was found to constitute as much as 7% of the foods in some districts of Lithuania, but only contributed 0.6% of the foods overall in the country.   ",1
5060,"All told, no less than 80 rodent species are known to be taken by tawny owls. ",0
5061,"While most of these are characteristic prey such as various voles and lemmings and any type of murid rodent from the smallest available mice to the largest available rats, other rodents also taken.   ",1
5062,"Black rats (Rattus rattus) were noted to be the main prey for tawny owls in Sicily, where they accounted for 35.3% by number of 351 prey items and 60.2% of the biomass, resulting in a relative high mean prey mass of 79.7 g (2.81 oz ",0
5063,"Strong biomass contributions were noted of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) elsewhere such as in Lublin in Poland (wherein they accounted for 41.5% of the biomass) and in Algeria (wherein they accounted for about 20% of the biomass), although many rats taken are on the young side rather than large adults, especially of the large brown species.    ",1
5064,"The tawny owl's prey spectrum also extends to less accessible prey like squirrels (including ground squirrels), with more or less all the species of Europe and western Asia known to be taken by these owls despite their diurnality, as well as the nocturnal but scarce flying squirrels.       ",1
5065,"The widespread red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), estimated to weigh an average of 150 to 300 g (5.3 to 10.6 oz) when taken, appear to recognize the tawny owl as a serious threat, with ones exposed to recordings of their calls recorded to interrupt feedings, engage in rapid movements and scold harshly.     ",1
5066,Hamsters may too be taken despite favoring and occurring in more open habitats than those usually hunted by tawny owls.     ,1
5067,"In the southerly parts of the range, as they've acclimated to semi-desert, tawny owls can sometimes partially off of quite different murid rodents like jirds and gerbils as well as the non-murid blind mole rats.     ",1
5068,Rodent prey may range up to the size of probable juveniles of the non-native nutria (Myocastor coypus).  ,1
5069,"Shrews are a common component of the foods of tawny owls, less so their larger but generally less numerous distant cousins such as moles and hedgehogs. ",0
5070,More than 20 species of shrew are known in the foods of this owl.   ,1
5071,"While usually secondary, shrews are widely present in the pellets and prey remains in most studies. ",0
5072,Unlike some owls such as long-eared owls they do not seem to disdain these musky-tasting and slight insectivores.   ,1
5073,Certainly the most reported variety would be the widespread common shrew (Sorex araneus).  ,1
5074,"Exceptionally, in a large food study for Belgium, common shrews were the leading prey species, at 18.2% of 15,450 prey items.  ",1
5075,"In a much smaller study in Norway during the summer, the common shrew was the leading prey species, constituting 30.4% of 69 prey items.  ",1
5076,"However, given their small size, with the common shrew being one of the larger available species at merely 8 to 11 g (0.28 to 0.39 oz), shrews are a marginal contributor to the owl's prey biomass and taken for subsistence until a more substantial food source is available.    ",1
5077,"Exceptional quantities of shrews may be predicted in French studies (usually during preferred prey shortages), with shrew prey contributing up to 15% of the biomass overall and more locally, in the Oignies, to 29% of the biomass.   Despite the low numbers of moles that are usually hunted, species such as the European mole (Talpa europaea) can be contribute heartily to the prey biomass, such as in Wytham, where the species made up 15.6% of the biomass.  ",1
5078,"Although such prey is known to be relatively limited in the species' foods, tawny owls are known to hunt the smallest living mammal species (by weight), the 1.8 g ",0
5079,"(0.063 oz) Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), up to the size of the largest mole, the 440 g (16 oz) Russian desman (Desmana moschata), as well as perhaps larger still, some small adults of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus).    ",1
5080,"On occasion, tawny owls will prey on young European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as well as very young hares. ",0
5081,"Mostly neonatal or scarcely older rabbits are taken, with a few studies estimating the mean weight as caught as only 100 to 350 g (3.5 to 12.3 oz).    Access to European rabbit was said to cause the mean prey mass of tawny owls in parts of the Netherlands to an unprecidently high 130 g (4.6 oz).  One Spanish study claimed that up to 23% of the vertebrate prey for the tawny owl was made up of by rabbits, making them the smallest known avian predator to show a dependence on them.  ",1
5082,"Though generally a minor part of the diet, a wide diversity of bats are taken by tawny owls, with over 30 species in their prey spectrum.      ",1
5083,"Usually less than 1% of vertebrate prey consists of bats but in Poland, dietary relations have been studied between tawny owls living near bat caves and urban bat roosts, and locally up to as much as 2% of the diet (and 5.3% of the mammalian foods) can consist of bats. ",0
5084,Studies have indicated that bat species are more or less hunted in proportion to their occurrence in mixed colonies and are taken more so within urbanized environments as well as when staple rodent prey is low.    ,1
5085,"In Austria, 252 attacks by tawny owls were recorded at a colony of Geoffroy's bats (Myotis emarginatus), 31 of which were successful.  ",1
5086,"In Great Britain, it is estimated that tawny owls eliminate at minimum 140,000 individual bats annually.  ",1
5087,"While most bats encountered (and hunted) are fairly small-bodied, tawny owls may hunt bats of all sizes available, from the roughly 4 g (0.14 oz) common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) to the 59 g (2.1 oz) greater noctule (Nyctalus lasiopterus) in Europe and to the 140 g (4.9 oz) Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) outside of Europe.    Other mammalian prey recorded have been mustelids. ",1
5088,"The tawny owl is known to hunt both common weasels in Europe, including fairly large stoats (Mustela erminea), weighing averages of up to 200 to 300 g (7.1 to 10.6 oz), despite the potential risk of counterattacking by these bold and powerful hunters.     ",1
5089,"Traces of an even bigger mustelid have been found, the European pine marten (Martes martes), in the foods of tawny owls, though it is a considerable possibility that this was scavenged rather than killed by the owl, much like the verified case of tawny owls scavenging remains of European polecats ",0
5090,(Mustela putorius).   Tawny owls do not take birds as commonly as mammals. ,1
5091,"Unlike the unrelated lineages of diurnal birds of prey, owls in general seldom prefer avian prey, with most varieties preferring small mammals and/or insects, except on a local basis (the closest to a specialized hunter of other birds are some in the pygmy owl genus).    Tawny owls do opportunistically hunt birds through most of the range, however.  ",1
5092,"When it comes to avian prey, there is little evidence that any particular kind is sought out and the owls are likely to randomly come across other birds as an alternate food choice.  ",1
5093,"Usually, European studies show that birds normally constitute less than 15% of the total foods of this owl.    ",1
5094,"In central Europe within an older study, 6000 bird prey (or a little less than 10% of the recorded prey) items were recorded of nearly 100 species, 33% of which were sparrows.  ",1
5095,"When capturing avian prey, the tawny owls not only pluck the prey but also often decapitate and inflict fairly extensive skeletal damage, especially when the victim is a relatively large bird.   ",1
5096,"When a population of great (Parus major) and Eurasian blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) was artificially increased by researchers in the vicinity of tawny owl nests, it was found that, despite the tits not being common food, the owls did reduce the population of increased tit. ",0
5097,"Many more tits were taken during snow cover or while incubating, with male tits being often being taken in larger numbers, and tit numbers were further reduced when fewer rodents were available.  ",1
5098,"In Gothenburg, Sweden, on 26 tawny territories the diversity of songbird species was higher (at 12.83 average species) inside tawny territories than outside (10.3 species). ",0
5099,"Attempts to study whether songbirds were significant in the foods found that bird altogether amounted to 6.78% of the total prey numbers (most likely to be thrushes), so were not significantly effected here.  ",1
5100,"As is the case with other medium-sized owls in Europe, there is some evidence that local snow cover, arid habitats and/or urbanization will increase the importance of avian prey.   ",1
5101,There was a fairly strong indication of local urban habitat causing the tawny owl to take a large quantity of bird prey in Grunewald. ,0
5102,"Here, among 13,359 prey items, bird constituted 35.9% with primary prey of this group being house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and European greenfinch (Chloris chloris) and that avian prey was more reliable and productive in the area than rodent prey due to the cyclic populations of the latter.  ",1
5103,"Elsewhere in Germany, in the Pankow borough of Berlin, the house sparrow was also the most regular prey species, at 19.2% of 1912 prey items.  ",1
5104,"The diet of tawny owls in the Polish city of TorunÌ was also dominated by birds, with them making up 47.8% by number and 51.8% of the biomass against 39.8% of the number and 36.1% of the biomass by mammals. ",0
5105,"Here the diet was led by the house sparrow (25.9% by number, 22.6% biomass) and secondarily the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus).  ",1
5106,"In Warsaw, birds were dominant in the city, at 73% of the food. ",0
5107,"However, much like TorunÌ, in the rural or outer suburban vicinity (i.e. the Kampinos Forest) outside the urbanized areas of Warsaw, other prey such as rodents and frogs were favored instead.   ",1
5108,"The urbanization effect was particularly strongly noted in England, where birds constituted only about 4% of the foods in the countryside per two studies, but in Wythenshawe part of Manchester and Holland Park in London, birds made up 89% and 93% of the foods, respectively. ",0
5109,"The most important avian foods to English tawny owls were the house sparrow (at 27% and 52% in Wythenshawe and Holland Park), the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (at 33% in Wythenshawe) and the rock dove (at 22% in Holland Park).  ",1
5110,"Some urban pairs in Italy derived about 50% of their food from rock doves and common swifts (Apus apus) of all ages, grabbing prey of the two species directly off their building ledge nests.  ",1
5111,"In the Sahel of Algeria, where small native rodents are scarce, birds account for about 39% of the diet tawny owls amongst 2472 prey items, in particular the house and Spanish sparrows (Passer hispaniolensis), at 16.6% by number and 17% by biomass.  Birds strongly dominated the foods of tawny owls in the Levant area, such as northern Israel, accounting for more than 70% of 229 prey items, especially Passer species.  ",1
5112,"In the northern stretches of the range, when birds are taken, slightly larger avian prey such as thrushes, often averaging about 80 g (2.8 oz), tend to be taken instead of sparrows and the like.   ",1
5113,"In Amsterdamse-Waterleidingduinen area of the Netherlands, birds tended to dominate the biomass especially medium-sized passerines such as common starlings and Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), with these contributing 54% of the biomass in high Apodemus mouse years to 62.7% in low mouse years in MarchâMay. ",0
5114,Smaller birds such as birds decrease from 21.1 to 3.1% in the spring while large birds such as pigeons and Eurasian woodcocks (Scolopax rusticola) may increase from 16.2 to 37.7% during high and low years for mice.  ,1
5115,"In a small study from Norway, a large portion of diet consisted of birds in summer (61% of the biomass but only 23.2% by number) while, in winter, voles almost completely dominated the foods.  ",1
5116,"A huge diversity of birds may be taken by tawny owls, although most are not numerically significant.  Slightly over half of the avian prey spectrum for tawny owls are various passerines down to the size of Europe's smallest bird, the 5.2 g (0.18 oz) goldcrest (Regulus regulus).   ",1
5117,"At the other end of the size scale for passerine prey are corvids, including jays, magpies and assorted crows.    ",1
5118,"In some cases, tawny owls have apparently preyed on adult crows of around their own size or slightly larger, such as an estimated 572 g ",0
5119,"Frequently, the largest prey item found in dietary studies for tawny owls are relatively outsized birds, such as the aforementioned crow, or an estimated 220 g (7.8 oz) western jackdaw (Corvus monedula) in central Italy and a common kestrel (Falco tinniculus) of the same estimated weight in Suffolk.    ",1
5120,"Although many species of dove are also taken,  rock doves and common wood pigeon, the latter taken frequently as adults and estimated to average at 480 g (1.06 lb) when taken in England by two different studies, can be very hearty prey.   ",1
5121,"Other large avian prey reported taken as adults by tawny owls (many of which approach or exceed the owls themselves in body mass) includes green-winged teal (Anas crecca),  red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica),  hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia),  ",1
5122,"Eurasian coot (Fulica atra),   black-headed gull,  black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla)  and black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius).  Larger gamebirds have been taken such as black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) as well as are some large birds of prey are sometimes found in the foods of tawny owls but it is not clear ",1
5123,"In at least one case, a tawny owl preyed upon an adult mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), which, at a mean weight of around 1,060 g (2.34 lb), is about twice a tawny owl's size and possibly the largest prey known to be tackled by the species.    ",1
5124,Little evidence has been found of tawny owl predation on reptiles. ,0
5125,"Despite their scarcity about a dozen species are known to be hunted by this predator, including a couple species of snake and several lizard species.      ",1
5126,"They are more or less taken incidentally, constituting always less than 2% of the foods in known European studies.    ",1
5127,"An exceptional case was in Sahel, Algeria, where the Moorish gecko (Tarentola mauritanica) was the leading prey species at 16.75% of 2472 prey items.  ",1
5128,"Amphibians are generally much more prominent in the tawny owl's diet, almost exclusively frogs.  Nearly 20 species of amphibian are known to be taken, which includes two species of newt outside of the more typical frogs and toads.      ",1
5129,"Key to predation on frogs is the composition of the habitat, with frogs and toads being apparently much more accessible in remote and conserved areas rather than developed lands.  ",1
5130,"In different areas of Poland, the Rana genus of frogs led the prey composition such as in BiaÅowiezÌa Forest, where they made up 21.1% of the foods, in Wigry National Park where they constituted 17.4% of the diet and in the northeasterly section of the country where they made up 23.4% of 2046 vertebrate prey items.    ",1
5131,"Of 3194 prey items in Finland, amphibians (probably all frogs) were secondary to rodents, and could account for from 16.6% in good vole years to 19.5%, the leading prey type by number, in bad vole years, with an average 17.5%. from all years.  ",1
5132,"In Lithuania, frogs constituted 14.5% of 1125 prey items, with the common frog (Rana temporaria) in particular accounting  for 11.2%.  ",1
5133,"In Sahel, Algeria, the Mediterranean painted frog (Discoglossus pictus) was a fairly important prey resource, at 9.22% by number and 10.5% by biomass.  ",1
5134,"The average size of frogs taken can be fairly variable, from an estimated 7 to 39.8 g (0.25 to 1.40 oz), as claimed for central Italy and England, respectively.   ",1
5135,"There are now several instances known of tawny owls preying on fish, though they are not known to be a significant food source anywhere in the distribution.   ",1
5136,"About eight species of wild fish are known to have been captured, including probably young or infirm specimens of large fish such as northern pike (Esox lucius) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), with at least some instances of tawny owls also catching ornamental goldfish (Carassius auratus) as well.     ",1
5137,The tawny owl feeds more extensively on invertebrates than many of the more northerly European studies would indicate.  ,1
5138,"Virtually, any variety of edible invertebrate would be eaten by these owls, though generally insects are taken due to the high occurrence of encounters. ",0
5139,"In the more southerly parts of Europe, much stronger numbers of invertebrates tend to be detected.  ",1
5140,"In central Italy, invertebrates constituted 53.3% of 654 prey items, in particular scarab beetles (15.8%), land snails (12.1%), ground beetles (5.3%), Orthoptera (5.14%) and longhorn beetles (5%).  ",1
5141,"In the vicinity of Umbria in Italy, 47.8% of 874 prey items were invertebrates, particularly keelback slugs and roundback slugs, which together made up 28.6% of the prey items followed among invertebrates by Melolonthinae subfamily of scarab beetles at about 7% of the prey.  ",1
5142,"In MuraÌnska planina National Park in Slovakia, keelback slugs were the most identified prey type among 13,912 prey items, accounting for 26.1%.  Keelback slugs were also the main prey type in Bulgaria (accounting for 24.6% of 529 prey items), and detected in strong numbers in Romania, the Caucasus and Crimea (wherein they made up 21.8% of 514 prey items, but trailed by number the yellow-necked mouse).  ",1
5143,"A strong dominance of insect prey was detected in food studies from Spain, with 64.3% of 1002 prey items from across the nation being invertebrates. ",0
5144,"In the Spanish region, the wood mouse was the identified single prey species (at 20% by number and 21% by biomass) but was closely followed by bush crickets (at 19.76% and 1.5% biomass), Rhizotrogus aestivus (10.76% by number, 0.5% biomass), European field cricket (Gryllus campestris) (8.85% by number, 1% biomass), minotaur beetle (Typhaeus typhoeus) (7.92% #, 1% biomass) and common dor beetle (Anoplotrupes stercorosus) (4.35% by number, 1% biomass).  More locally within the Province of LeoÌn, beetles collectively constituted 35.1% of the diet and Orthoptera constituted 14.4%.  ",1
5145,"In Sahel, Algeria, invertebrates in total slightly outnumbered mammals, but lagged slightly behind birds in number.  ",1
5146,"In general, insects in central and northern Europe are a regular but secondary food source, taken in similar volume to birds but far less significant as contributors to biomass.    ",1
5147,Tawny owls are said to take beetles in central Europe more frequently in Aprilâ ,0
5148,"An exceptional case of invertebrates being primary as a food source in a northerly country was recorded in the Peak District of England, wherein earthworms were the primary food type, at 40.4% of 926 prey items and 15.6% of the biomass. ",0
5149,"Strong numbers were detected here too of Geotrupes beetles, contributing 14% of the prey numbers.  ",1
5150,"In every part of its range, tawny owls co-exist with other birds of prey, with other owls presenting the strongest possibility for competition given their overlapping food selection and shared nocturnality. ",0
5151,"As perhaps the most numerous and one of the most widely distributed in the continent of the 13 owl species regularly occurring in Europe, ecological interactions of some kind have been recorded with most other species.   ",1
5152,"Given their medium-sized frame and general adaptability, of special interest is how they co-exist with other medium-sized owls such as long-eared owls and barn owls.  ",1
5153,Many studies have contrasted particularly the food habits of long-eared owls living in proximity to tawny owls. ,0
5154,"Generally speaking, the long-eared owls in Europe are much more strongly disposed to being a specialist species than the tawny owl, relying almost entirely on voles. ",0
5155,"Although in the broad picture, the long-eared also feeds on other prey such as birds and insects, their food niche breadth is consistently lower than that of the tawny owls. ",0
5156,"For example, in a very large study of central Europe, the common vole species alone constituted about 76% of 57,500 prey items for long-eared owls.     Long-eared owls also differ strongly from tawny owls in selecting much more open hunting grounds, such as old fields, usually hunting on the wing rather than from a perch and in utilizing abandoned (and often rather open) bird nests rather than natural cavities as nesting sites.    ",1
5157,"In terms of peri-urbanisation, the long-eared and tawny owls are more or less equally adaptive to such areas.  ",1
5158,"The food niche breadth is usually greater in Europe for the tawny owl than for the barn owl as well,   although the barn owl appears to have a stronger liking of shrews as prey than does the tawny owl (shrews more than twice as often ",1
5159,"The barn owl, although also by nature a cavity nester, does not generally acclimate to well-wooded areas where the tawny owl is at home.  ",1
5160,"Both the long-eared and barn owls prefer voles where they are available, especially as both often hunt in open areas where they are common, whereas Apodemus mice tend to be slightly preferred by tawny owls.    ",1
5161,"When conflicts ensue, the tawny owl tends to dominate these other medium-sized owls. ",0
5162,"This is in part due to their size advantage, with the tawny being larger by an average of 32% (of 3 standards of measurements, two from the wing, one by body mass) than the long-eared owl and 24% larger than the barn owl.   ",1
5163,"Tawny owls are known to readily evict barn owls from their own nest sites, normally when taking up residency in towns or cities.  ",1
5164,"It was additionally found that barn owls, being a species better adapted to warmer, more tropical areas, is at higher risk of starvation in cool weather than long-eared and tawny owls, with proportionately many more found dead in winter in France due presumably to inferior lipid fat reserves.  ",1
5165,"In the British Isles, the tawny owl is the largest and most powerful year-around native owl, ahead slightly of the long-eared and barn owls. ",0
5166,"Therefore, the tawny owl may be considered an apex predator here (despite still being vulnerable occasionally to diurnal raptors and ground predators). ",0
5167,"However, since the tawny owl never colonized Ireland, here the long-eared owl is the largest year-around owl (in these island much larger owls are very rare winter visitors, in the case of the snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) or are probably accidentally introduced by humans, as is likely the Eurasian eagle-owl).    ",1
5168,"However, in much of mainland Europe and elsewhere, tawny owls potentially overlap with larger owls and, depending on habitat composition and prey accessibilities, may be considered more correctly a mesopredator.   ",1
5169,"Mainly in parts of northern and eastern Europe, tawny owls sometimes co-exist with their larger cousins, Ural owls. ",0
5170,The Ural owl has generally similar nesting and feeding habits but tends to occur in slightly different habitats. ,0
5171,"Generally, the Ural is more broadly adaptive to taiga and similarly conifer based forests than are tawny owls and is also somewhat more likely to be active during daylight.      ",1
5172,A relatively low territory overlap of 13.3% was detected in Slovakia between tawny and Ural owl territories due to their differing habitats.  ,1
5173,"Depending on range, the prey sizes taken by tawny owls tend to be considerably smaller than those selected by the more powerful Ural owl, with the latter's mean prey sizes averaging from 31 to 50% larger. ",0
5174,"However, the food niche breadth is up to two and a half times greater in the tawny than in the Ural owl.   ",1
5175,The Ural owl tends to dominate interspecific conflicts with tawny owls.    ,1
5176,"On the contrary, in at least one case a tawny owl was observed to fiercely attack and drive off a Ural owl (although it may not be ruled out that this was a case of mobbing).    ",1
5177,"A third and much larger still Strix species, the great grey owl, differs considerably in almost all respects of its life history from tawny owls. ",0
5178,"The great grey is adapted to taiga and other conifer based forests, both open and enclosed, and relies almost exclusively on voles for food. ",0
5179,"Almost cathemeral in activity, the great grey species may nest in a broad variety of situations in the boreal habitat but never utilizes tree cavities as does the tawny. ",0
5180,"Due to the latter species' specialization, the tawny owl is spared from any known ecological interactions with the great grey owl.   ",1
5181,Much more dangerous than larger Strix species to the tawny owl is the Eurasian eagle-owl. ,0
5182,"A similar wide-ranging generalist, the eagle owl most often nests in and around rock formations, often in fairly mountainous areas, but locally is also adaptive to varying habitats and may too nesting in old birds nests or on the ground, usually between the trunks of large trees.    ",1
5183,"In terms of their dietary habits, the eagle owl appears to be perhaps an even more indiscriminate predator, attacking animals of all taxonomic classes unfortunate enough to encounter them. ",0
5184,"Given its far larger size and much more powerful features, the eagle owl will attack much larger prey than tawny owls, even relative to their own size.    ",1
5185,"Tawny owls are likely to avoid encounters with eagle-owls and are fortunate in many areas that the eagle-owl, which requires a larger home range and tends to more exclusively prefer remote areas than tawnys, can be scarce to absent in some parts of Europe.   ",1
5186,"In some areas of Spain and Italy, tawny owls have adapted to live in the vicinity of wooded montane areas and even to nesting within rock formations. ",0
5187,"Both countries have healthy recovered populations of eagle-owls, so tawny owls appear to locally restrict their vocal activity and tend to occur on the fringes or outside active eagle-owl ranges.    Unlike their larger, more powerful cousin, the Ural owl, the tawny owl is not infrequently vicim to predation by larger raptors.     ",1
5188,"They tend to be taken somewhat less than other medium-sized owls, especially long-eared owls, by eagle owls by virtue of using woodlands ",0
5189,(which differ somewhat from the habitats usually used by eagle-owls) and nesting in tree hollows.   ,1
5190,The other greatest predatory threat is certain to be the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis).   ,1
5191,"There are at least a hundred cases of goshawks taking the owls and, unlike the eagle-owl, the habitats of the goshawks do fairly closely mirror those of tawny owls with the owls only spared by its different primary times of activity.    ",1
5192,"Other predators long known to have taken tawny owls have included their larger cousins, the Ural owls as well as common buzzards (Buteo buteo), red kites (Milvus milvus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus).   ",1
5193,"In addition, more reported raptorial predators have included the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata),  golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos),  eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca)  and black kite (Milvus migrans)  ",1
5194,"Outside of traditionally raptorial groups, birds such as corvids may destroy and/or compromise tawny owl nests, either for food, anti-predator behaviour and/or competition. ",0
5195,"Western jackdaws, in particular, appear to be persistent competitors for nest sites and sometimes are aggressive enough as to displace tawny owls from a disputed site. ",0
5196,"In extreme cases of competition with jackdaws, the owls may bring themselves to starvation trying to incubate their nests in the hole when a murder of jackdaws continuously visit, harass and place a new nest on top of the owl's eggs repeatedly. ",0
5197,"In other cases, the owls nestlings have been suffocated by the jackdaws building a nest directly on top of the still living owl broods.    Mammalian predators are a fairly frequent threat to tawny owls as well, though tend to attack almost exclusively during the breeding season.  European pine martens are known to be a considerable threat of all aged tawny owls at nests from nestlings to brooding females, as are probably stone martens (Martes foina).    ",1
5198,"In a food study in France, 9% of the diet of pine martens was found to consist of tawny owls, with the data indicating that owls using nest boxes are more vulnerable to martens.  ",1
5199,"Especially once reaching or around the age of fledging, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are known to take several young tawny owls (and perhaps an unwary adult), at times taking up to 39% of young owls in a population, as are probably cats (Felis silvestris) in some areas.   ",1
5200,"However, in chance encounters during the day, tawny owls have been known to attack and successfully chase off pine martens and have been seen to do the same to red foxes, cats and dogs.   ",1
5201,The tawny owl is a considerable predator itself of smaller owls. ,0
5202,"Data indicates that it is second deadliest owl to the smaller species of owl in Europe, behind only the eagle owl.   Among their known owl prey species are Eurasian scops owls (Otus scops),  ",1
5203,"Additionally, they may hunt smaller diurnal birds of prey such as Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus),  common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus),  ",1
5204,"Reports of tawny owls killing common buzzards and northern goshawks are of nebulous detail and may refer in fact to nighttime nest robberies rather than overpowering adults of these larger, dangerous and often seemingly avoided raptors.  ",1
5205,"Evidence from Slovenia has indicated that the tawny owl is more feared by small owls such as the boreal owl than even the larger, more powerful Ural owl, as they clustered more strongly as can be explained by habitat in the realm of Ural owl territories but seemed to avoid where possible tawny owl territories.   ",1
5206,"Although there are more known instances of tawny owls hunting little owls, data in central Europe could not distinguish whether little owls were avoiding tawny owls or the wooded habitats they frequent to account for their sometimes spotty ranges.  ",1
5207,"However, when forced to nest in quite close proximity to tawny owls and other medium-sized owl species due to clustered ""islands"" of habitat remaining in southeastern Poland, the productivity of little owls appeared to lower.  Predation by tawny owls can be severe as well on Eurasian pygmy owls, to such an extent that they may have cause the regional extinction of the pygmy around World War II in the Black Forest after the smaller species was already depleted by deforestation. ",1
5208,"A successful reintroduction of Eurasian pygmys into the forest was followed by a natural range expansion back into the forest by tawnys, which again threatens the population growth of smaller owl.   ",1
5209,"Young birds select territories and look for mates in autumn and tend to be very vocal, especially males.   ",1
5210,"Due to their highly territorial behaviour, young birds frequently struggle to establish a territory unless a nearby adult dies. ",0
5211,Territories have been known to have been maintained by single tawnys for up to 10 years in Russia and 13 years in Berlin.   ,1
5212,"Of 34 males in Wytham, only one male moved off of territory, due to being disturbed by humans.  ",1
5213,It appears to be largely up to the male to select territorial boundaries.  ,1
5214,"Despite the aforementioned territorial behaviour, active nests of two separate pairs at as close as 100 m (330 ft), in the Tegel forest, have been reported.  ",1
5215,"In Switzerland for example, a study of 137 nestings found that only one, or 0.7%, were from a different father than the mate, females cannot generally raise young without male contribution so the pair structure of these highly residential owls insures little instance of cuckoldry.  Cases of bigamy were reported at Wytham in 6 of 34 males, in situations where apparently a neighboring male died and was suffixed subsequently, however, one or the other nesting attempts would completely fail each time.   ",1
5216,"The male advertises several potential nest sites to his mate by singing at the entrance, slipping inside and so on, with the female finally selecting one.  ",1
5217,"The typical nest site of a tawny owl is a tree hollow, wherein the owls will nest directly on the interior hole's surface. ",0
5218,"Tree hollows used may be as much as 25 m (82 ft) above the ground, but are usually within about 12 m (39 ft) of the ground.  ",1
5219,Virtually any species of deciduous tree may be used provided holes are available. ,0
5220,"These tree cavities may be of any origin, with trees that grow large such as oak, beech, poplar, maple, lime, hornbeam and alder often regularly utilized.     Female may scratch out a shallow base in soil if present and sometimes seen to reportedly tear eggs into pieces as a cushion from their broods.  Othe tree nest locations have included those on top of a Witch's broom and on top of the tree canopy.  ",1
5221,"Natural holes in trees are often the most frequently used nesting site, followed closely in recent decades many artificial nest boxes, preferably those with a 15 cm Ã 20 cm (5.9 in Ã 7.9 in) entrance or larger.   Of the nest boxes erected in different parts from Kielder forest and the Glenbranter forest of Argyll, 592 nest boxes were placed at 1.6 to 5.2 m (5.2 to 17.1 ft) high along the side of trees and 17.4% of which were used by tawnys (in latter 2 years of study up to 24.1%).  ",1
5222,"In southeastern Scotland, all nest boxes erected in habitat were eventually utilized by tawny owls.  ",1
5223,"Many nest boxes were recorded to be used as roost sites in the Milan area, with only 12.3% of the 44% of nest boxes actually used by owls for breeding, usually with the owls utilizing boxes that were at least 6 m (20 ft) above the ground.  Nest boxes are most successful wherever natural tree cavities are scarce or absent, such as conifer forests, young successional woods and farmlands.    ",1
5224,Tawny owls may not infrequently nest in an unmodified black woodpecker hole.  ,1
5225,"This species may too nest in nest of larger birds such as crows, common ravens (Corvus corax) and Eurasian magpies as well as common buzzards, black kites, northern goshawks and various eagles while the sometimes recorded as used smaller nests such as those of Eurasian jays, Eurasian sparrowhawks and common wood pigeons but these are at potential risk of collapse. [4Occasionally ",1
5226,", tawny owls have also been recorded nesting in abandoned burrows of larger mammals (e.g. red fox and European badger (Meles meles) as well as those of rabbits).   ",1
5227,"Other nesting locations recorded for the species have included bare cliff ledges, between the roots of heavy tree trunks, on the bare forest floor and among heather. ",0
5228,"Also rarer still nests have been reported in the recesses of stone walls, in chimneys of large buildings, on cabins and sheds, in dovecotes and church towers.   ",1
5229,"In southern Finland, 95% of 123 nest boxes put out were occupied by tawny owls in 1970â1975, natural tree hole use decreased in same period from 48% to 3%, on top of stumps from 4% to 1% and in buildings from 15% to 1%.  Laying normally begins in March-early April, sometimes as early as February.  ",1
5230,"Of 344 nests in Latvia, the mean egg laying dates were March 13 to April 3, with extreme dates of February 20 to April 30, with shifts accounted for by late winter weather.  ",1
5231,In the German area of Swabian Jura clutches may start to be laid as early as mid-February if food is favorable.[331 ,0
5232,] Egg laying in mid-February is fairly typical in Italy as well.  ,1
5233,"The first egg is typically laid by mid-March in Great Britain, in late March in continental Europe and early April in Scandinavia.  ",1
5234,"In very snowy years in Finland, the laying of clutch is often either delayed or does not occur at all.  ",1
5235,"Due to the warmer average ambient temperatures and access to pestilent rodents, wintertime egg laying in human developed areas is now known to be commonplace: with records of laying in late December in Amsterdam, early January in Munich and late January in Riga, Latvia.    ",1
5236,They tend to lay their clutches earlier than long-eared owls and little owls and much earlier than barn owls.   ,1
5237,One clutch is laid per year but rarely replacement clutches have been reported if an entire clutch is lost.  ,1
5238,"A record in Bizkaia, Spain of a second successful clutch was produced, with pairs of owlets were recorded in February then another pair of owlets apparently hatched to the same pair was recorded in July of same year.  ",1
5239,"The female typically lays a relatively small clutch of 3-5 eggs, sometimes in extreme case from 2 and very rarely and in the times of food plenty, 7â9.   ",1
5240,"Average clutch sizes were cited as 2.67 in Britain, 2.8 in Bohemia, 2.95 in Belgium 3.29 in central Europe, 3.3 in both Switzerland and the Netherlands, 3.65 in Denmark, 3.64-3.81 in Finland and 4.04 in Sweden.         ",1
5241,"While in Bohemia, the clutch size varied remarkably little by year, in western Switzerland it could go from 2.52 to 3.63 in different years and Finnish data indicates it can vary from 3.1 to 4.2 in low and peak vole years. ",0
5242,"Therefore, clutch size may be more variable in more cool climatic zones but, on the other hand, the average size of the clutches averages larger in these colder areas.      ",1
5243,"Although clutch sizes average smaller in Great Britain than in mainland Europe, they are more consistently laid there than the clutches of barn owls.  ",1
5244,"Their eggs are pure white, smooth or slightly glossy in texture, and vary little in size. ",0
5245,"Egg dimensions were found to average 46.7 mm Ã 39.1 mm (1.84 in Ã 1.54 in) in Britain, 47.6 mm Ã 39.2 mm (1.87 in Ã 1.54 in) in central Europe, 46.6 mm Ã 38.5 mm (1.83 in Ã 1.52 in) in Sweden (Makatsch 1976) and 47.5 mm Ã 39.2 mm (1.87 in Ã 1.54 in) in Russia. ",0
5246,The range may be from 42 to 50 mm (1.7 to 2.0 in) in height by 36 to 41 mm (1.4 to 1.6 in) in diameter (sample size 100).     ,1
5247,The average weight of eggs can vary from 31.3 to 40 g (1.10 to 1.41 oz).   ,1
5248,"The female incubates alone, starting with the first egg for 28â29 days typically, and is fed by the male.  ",1
5249,"The female also broods the chicks, feeding them strips of meat for about 2 weeks, after which they may start swallowing mice and such whole. ",0
5250,"She continues to feed them until they leave the nest, at which point she may resume her hunting but the male may continue to a majority of food capture and may even feed the offspring directly.   ",1
5251,"Larger prey items tend to be more often fed to chicks such as medium-sized birds, young rabbits and moles where available, while the parents themselves usually eat small rodents (i.e. in Wytham and Ythan Valley).   ",1
5252,"Sometimes when the mother feeds their young, separated feathers are sometimes doled out and consumed by them.  ",1
5253,"In France, 4â19 prey deliveries by the male were recorded per night, or 2.5â3 prey per chick nightly.  ",1
5254,"In Belgium, from as little as 0 to 22 prey items were recorded to be delivered per night, on average 3.7 (range 2.3â5.1) prey per chick nightly.  Up to 21% of prey deliveries were done in daylight in Wytham whereas in the Netherlands only 2% were during daytime.   ",1
5255,"In one British nest, with three owlets (the oldest being 15â25 days old) each chick received about 88 g (3.1 oz) of food per night while later near fledging, each would get 124 to 141 g (4.4 to 5.0 oz) per night.  ",1
5256,"In an experiment study, broods were both increased and decreased to see if males differed their food deliveries, it was found that the males did change their food delivers as a result of brood increase or decrease, with the decreased broods being fed well while the increased broods were food stressed and showed particular signs of declining condition of the brooding female as she had less food for herself.  ",1
5257,"Instrinic factors were weighed about the condition of parents in a study from Finland, with the female's age being the most significant factors that could be determined. ",0
5258,"Furthermore, it was found that male condition was the most important factor for female condition, with older males often in better physical condition.  ",1
5259,"Weather conditions were found to be intrinsic with condition of parents in Finland, and further that larger females could breed earlier and more successfully on average.  ",1
5260,A study of steroid hormones in a selected 51 pairs within Denmark (from a network of 204 nest boxes) were used to measure hormone levels. ,0
5261,"It was found that testostrone levels were consistently higher in 3 year old birds of both sexes, birds of this age were more productive in all aspects of breeding than younger owls, although it was not clear to what extent higher breeding success to attributable to hormonal levels versus experience.  ",1
5262,A testing of testosterone levels in owl offspring within Danube-Ipoly National Park in Hungary determined that experienced parents produced nestlings with more testostrone mainly in correlation with mild weather. ,0
5263,The testostrone levels in the Hungarian study were found to be lowest in poor weather conditions in the last of the owl's broods and most such young usually died during the early nesting period.  ,1
5264,"When they are alarmed or required to act in self-defense near the nest, tawny owls of all ages but especially older nestlings up to fledging age, have been recorded to raise feathers and outstretch wings, to their expand size and possible shield itself, also snapping their bills.  ",1
5265,"Despite the tawny owl's reputation as a highly aggressive bird when encroached upon,  the parents are usually retiring even when the area of the nest is broached.  Passive measures are usually taken first in parental nest defense.  ",1
5266,"The mother owls are often tight sitters, one female sat motionless even as she was physically turned over, while another sat tight but flushed eventually after several human intrusions.   ",1
5267,Sometimes parents engage in distraction display when attempting to protect their young but less frequently than do long-eared owls.  ,1
5268,"There is much individual variation in aggressiveness of response to disturbance and threats, with a similar occasional but widely reported tendencies for aggressiveness in nest defense in many other Strix owls as well.   ",1
5269,"In the earlier part of the nestling period, males sometimes launch defensive attacks but these tend to be relatively mild and no physical contact is often made.  ",1
5270,"In western Switzerland, females were 2.9 times more likely to respond aggressively to artificial nest predator stimuli than males.  ",1
5271,"Later into the nesting period, the female may begin showing more aggressive reactions to disturbance or threats.  ",1
5272,"Older females were found in a study show a more aggressive defense as well as those with larger broods and earlier nestings, however non-aggressive females were found to have more future reproductive years on average than aggressive ones.   ",1
5273,Rufous morph females were more vigorous in nest defense than other morphs in a study from Switzerland.  ,1
5274,"At the first detection of an intruder, the female may let out muffled hoots initially.  ",1
5275,"Attacks only tend to occur somewhat regularly in developed areas, especially city parks, where repeated intrusions occur and perhaps resulting desensitization and irritation.   ",1
5276,"Some individual females and rarely males become routine attackers on humans and may be known as ""furies"".    ",1
5277,In at least some cases parks may be closed due to unprovoked tawny owl attacks.  ,1
5278,"The female tends to attack humans from behind and focus on the head and shoulders when physical contact is made, especially if the person turns their back, but even then often veer short of physical contact. ",0
5279,"Humans are inefficient at fending off sudden physical attacks because of the silent flight of the owls.      Tawny owl mothers not infrequently attack threatening animals common in parks such as dogs and cats as well as martens (at times knocking them out of the trees) and red foxes, especially at dawn or early in the night.    ",1
5280,"Other than scalp abrasions, occular damage can be considerable when tawny owls attack humans.   ",1
5281,"Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost his left eye when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. ",0
5282,Young begin to call in about 24 hours before they hatch.   ,1
5283,"Asynchronous hatching occurs but is slightly less pronounced perhaps than long-eared and barn owls, rarely ranging up to 2â3 days apart.  ",1
5284,"The female broods the owlets closely until 10â15 days, rarely ceasing as early as 7 days.  ",1
5285,"In a Danish study, it was found that 59% of 268 nestlings were male, as opposed to roughly even sex ratio in Great Britain or Hungary, with the ratio not changing annually unlike clutch size, brood size and reproductive success.  ",1
5286,The gender of broods were studied relatively to testosterone levels in differently sized clutches in Hungary with smaller clutches with lower testosterone levels being male-biased. ,0
5287,"In this Hungarian study, survival rates were higher in smaller broods than in larger brood. ",0
5288,"Heavier parents raised all offspring hatched to them, while lighter parents raised 33% of the offspring. 59 of 99 reduced broods were males, while 34 of 81 unmodified broods male.  ",1
5289,"Although sometimes said to only fed young at night,  the mother can also parse out tiny bits of food by day to their nestlings.  ",1
5290,"The young are fed small bits of meat for about 12 days, at which point the young open their eyes and begin to more actively beg.   ",1
5291,"Also around 12 days, the nestlings produce their first pellets, though they are often of a rather liquid consistency.   ",1
5292,Older nestlings beg with quivering wings and intense high-pitched food begging calls.  ,1
5293,Female only regularly hunts again after brooding period (usually a little after the young are 2 weeks old).  ,1
5294,"The male tends not to enter the nest to make food delivery, often the female receives it nearby on a branch of the tree or at the entrance of the nest hole, later when the nestlings are large, the male often will silently deposit the prey directly into the nest without landing.   ",1
5295,"When they are 21â25 days old, the young are stronger on their legs and feet and begin to spend much time around the entrance of the nest hole. ",0
5296,"It was found in warmer conditions, that the owlets born to rufous morph mothers requires less oxygen consumption and may experience lower stress levels during their early development.  ",1
5297,"After leaving the nest and becoming ""branchers"", the young owls often clamber around using both the feet and the beak, and often land on the forest floor, from where they tend to flutter and climb into bushes, trying to reach higher parts of the trees (and should not be handled if found on the ground as such).    ",1
5298,"Finally, at 29â37 days, with an average of 32.1 days in Kielder Forest, the young fledge, but take about another two weeks before they can fly strongly.     The young post-fledgling owls continue to beg, often following and rarely leaving an area of about 50 m (160 ft) away from their mother.  ",1
5299,"The pre-dispersal young used an area of 5 to 15 ha (12 to 37 acres) in England while, in Scotland, it was only 2.2 to 6.5 ha (5.4 to 16.1 acres).   ",1
5300,"In Denmark, the distance between post-fledging siblings ranged from 11 to 0.6 m (36.1 to 2.0 ft) during day and 32 to 6 m (105 to 20 ft) by night, meaning that they are associative with one another at this stage, and they would spend 20-80% of nighttime hours food begging, up to 82% in poor food years.  ",1
5301,"At around 1 to 3 months (sooner in Denmark, later in England on average), the young tawny owls begin to hunt for themselves.  ",1
5302,"At the age of 2 to 3 months the young owls can be evicted by their parents, although often appear to disperse independently.    ",1
5303,"However, on average of 72 radio-tagged juveniles in Denmark after the young owls would stop begging for food at 90â123 days of age, they would typically roost within their parents territories for another 18 days without incident.  ",1
5304,"In the Danish Gribskov forest, 41 radio-tracked broods were dependent after fledging for a mean of 71 days (with a range of 56-84).  5 of 12 radiotagged juveniles survived dispersal in a different study from Denmark, independence was gained at an average 77.3 days and single day movements recorded of up to 4 km (2.5 mi).  22 radiotagged young tawny owls in England were tracked post-dispersal relative to vole concentrations, though there was no evidence that there were consistently able to access the peak vole areas. 27.4% of area selection was found to be likely correlated to vole access.  ",1
5305,"The age at first breeding may be early as one year, but is more commonly 2â3 years old and rarely not until 4 years old.   ",1
5306,"A study within oak-hornbeam-birch forest in Hungary on the breeding output of males, 77 males examined from the 1st breeding year until 9 years of age, increase breeding output from 2 to 4 years of age thence peaking at 5â6 in age. ",0
5307,"However, at older than this the male breeding output begins to decline, possibly due to senescence, perhaps since males may be unable to continue withhold high-quality territories from competition. ",0
5308,The 5 to 9-year-old males were flexible to prey variations in ways younger males were not.   ,1
5309,"In Hungary's Pilis Biosphere Reserve during 1992â2000, the age of females appeared to effect the number of eggs and hatching success, while the age of the male effected the number of fledglings, with 39 pairs studied. 98 females and 85 males were produced in a network of 180 nest boxes. ",0
5310,Again older males and females (i.e. 5 to 9) were seemingly more productive overall.  ,1
5311,"Hungarian data shows lower overall number of young during years with harsh, snowy winters but due to the low number of young, the successful raised young were stronger and in better condition on average once fully grown than the young owls in years with many offspring.  ",1
5312,"The breeding success overall in Lithuania has steadily increased, with a survival rate reached of 72% for females.  ",1
5313,"The area of Burgundy in France, productivity of successful pairs averaged 3.2, varying from 2 to 3 to 4 in poor, intermediate and good prey years.  ",1
5314,"In western Switzerland, over the course of 14 years, females produced an average of 5.67 fledglings.  On an area of 3,800 ha (9,400 acres) in the Netherlands, 9 successful breeding attempts were recorded, a very low density to such an extent that unlike many other parts of the range that attempts to attract owls with playback were largely unsuccessful.  ",1
5315,"As for breeding success near Rome in Italy, out of 326 attempts, 4-28% were successful in different years, with the number fledglings ranged from 0.4-1 overall and 1â1.18 per successful pair and habitats with more rainfall and less arid conditions being more productive.  ",1
5316,"Of 311 breeding attempts studied over a 13-year period in Rome, 59.5% failed in urban plots and 51.3% in suburban areas, with 18.5% and 23.4% in urban and suburban zones producing 1 fledgling, 12% and 18% producing 2, 8% and 7.2% producing 3 and 2% in the urban area producing 4. ",0
5317,"In Roman areas, the breeding rates are generally quite low but are fairly stable annually, due to warmer average ambient temperature and less local trophic competition. ",0
5318,"The total breeding success in Roman pairs was 43.5% in the city (also 0.83 fledglings per pair and 1.86 per successful pairs) and 51% in suburbs (also 0.82 fledglings per pair, 1.63 per successful pair).  ",1
5319,"Of 256 Belgian eggs, 24% did not hatch, 10% of those were deserted, 51% were adled and 39% were deserted or destroyed by the female when food supply was low. ",0
5320,"In the Belgian data, of 195 young hatched, 94% fledged and 6% died in nest as a result of starvation, with an average number of fledglings 2.06, varying from 0 to 3.25 on average in different years based on vole numbers.  ",1
5321,"In southern France, brood size for all pairs was 2.2 while for successful pair it was 3.2 (range 2â4.3 per pair). ",0
5322,"In the French study, cannibalism was reportedly surprisingly often to be committed by mother or siblings. 73.7% of the studied French broods produced fledglings.  Of 357 pairs in the woodlands around west Berlin in 2 decades starting 1958, 160 pairs produced 333 fledglings, with an average of 2.08 per successful nest. ",1
5323,"More broadly in the Berlin metropolitan, nesting success averaged 2.1 and 2.8 per successful nest, but could vary 2.7 to 3.2 on average in low and high vole years.  ",1
5324,"In eastern Bohemia, an average 2.6 young fledged per successful pair, but no determinable difference in productivity was noted during good and poor prey years.  ",1
5325,"Breeding success varied in Finland based on vole numbers, from 2.4-2.7 in poor years to 3.4-3.5 in good years, but only a slight variation was recorded in clutch size and young hatched.   ",1
5326,"Finland has shown a sharp increase overall in tawny owls in the recent three decades was from 422 to 1710 active territories found, from 198 to 1566 nests found and from 168 to 1341 successful nests found. ",0
5327,"When vole populations were high, the number of young tawny owls introduced into the population of Finland was ten times higher than in low years.  ",1
5328,"It was found in Denmark that a control group of 32 out of 131 radio-tagged young that were supplementally fed by researchers were more vulnerable to predation (36% of these died, mostly due to mammals like foxes around fledging age) but also earlier nests were vulnerable as well (more so to other birds of prey).  ",1
5329,"Of 562 eggs laid in Great Britain, 314 young hatched, with 44% lost before hatching and 2% lost before fledging.  ",1
5330,Cambridgeshire produced an average of 0.3 for all territories in fragmented woods and 0.89 for all territories in continuous woods.  ,1
5331,"This study of the English countryside showed that the owl population varied relatively little in proportion to the sharply cyclic nature of the main prey here, field voles and wood mice, due to the owl's ability to exploit alternate prey in poor rodent years.  ",1
5332,"In Scotland, perhaps with less diverse prey available in the more northern clime, the trends of tawny owls were more sharp: 2.6 fledglings were produced in good vole years, 1.65 average in declining years and 0.2 in poor vole years over a 7-year period.  ",1
5333,"Scottish data showed nestling mortality was higher in poor vole years, at about 31% vs 14% in good vole years, with no sex bias.  ",1
5334,"During low prey years in Wytham, anywhere from 33 to 77% of eggs produced are abandoned and may freeze, but little to no change occurs in territory occupancy.  ",1
5335,"Authors inferred that the parent owls in Kielder Forest are able to biological predict the vole numbers based on spring feeding access and produce more often the more productive sex, which were females here.  ",1
5336,Territorial changes in Kielder were associated to habitat and land use changes with 25% more territories recorded from 1981 to 1991 then a 21% reduction from 1992 to 1998.  ,1
5337,"In this area, due probably to the exotic conifer dominated forest, owls were quite dependent on field vole numbers in the openings, and could vary from twentyfold from low to high years, with 70% of the variance of productivity could be correlated to the habitat types available and show the importance of habitat heterogeneity.  ",1
5338,"In peak years at Kielder, of 197 attempts, 6.9% failed to breed and 28.3% successfully bred, in the increase years, of 44 attempts, 10.2% failed to breed and nesting successful was 76.2% and in the decrease years, of 62 attempts, 12.5% failed to breed and nesting success average was 69%.[387 ",0
5339,The oldest recorded in the wild in central Europe was 18 years and 7 months old while the oldest in Sweden recorded ,0
5340,These records were subsequently broken by a female recorded in the wild in Switzerland at an age of 21 years and 11 months.  ,1
5341,The species has been recorded to live to 27 years or so in captivity.   ,1
5342,"If voles are scarce and weather harsh during winter, many tawny owls die by various means (starvation being primary).  Starvation rates are high in newly independent young if there is no unoccupied territories in the vicinity (at least by 1 bird of their corresponding gender).  Mortality averaged about 15% in territorial adults in Wytham.  ",1
5343,"In Finland, Ural owl displaced tawny owls but great grey owl peaceably allow them in the vicinity.  ",1
5344,"Although moderately hardy during sub-freezing winters, severe winters can be dangerous in areas such as the Russian part of their range. [133 ",1
5345,] Mortality in general in the northern limits of the range is probably higher in the more temperate zone adapted tawny than it is in the Ural owl.  ,1
5346,"This species is increasingly affected by avian malaria, the incidence of which has tripled in the last 70 years, in parallel with increasing global temperatures. ",0
5347,An increase of one degree Celsius produces a two- to three-fold increase in the rate of malaria. ,0
5348,"In 2010, the incidence in British tawny owls was 60%, compared to 2â3% in 1996.  ",1
5349,"Of 22 radio-tagged young tawny owls in Kielder, 36.4% (8) owls died 10â106 days after fledgling but while still on parent's ranges, another 22.7% (5) died after leaving parents territory at 40â147 days after fledgling, 22.7% (5) also disappeared after fledged but while still dependent and were quite likely preyed upon while the only 4 remaining lost radio contact after leaving parent's range at 58â178 days after fledging. ",0
5350,"Of 13 certain to have died, 6 were due to starvation, 3 were due to predation by goshawks, one by an infected eye injury, while the rest of uncertain cause.  Mortality rates can be even higher elsewhere such as an average of about 92% in Scotland and about 61%  in Norway for juveniles before they disperse.   ",1
5351,"Meanwhile, recorded average mortality rates in the 1st year of radio-tagged tawny owl lives were recorded as the following averages: ",0
5352,"Sweden at 71.7%, Switzerland at 49.4%, England at 52.6%, west Germany at 48% and Belgium at 58%. ",0
5353,"Radiotagging studies showed average mortality for Swedish 2nd year owls was 44.3%, 24.5% at this point for Swiss owls and 22.2% for English ones while in the third year the Swedish one's mortality was estimated to average 47.6% and English ones at 31.8%.  ",1
5354,"The survival rate average over two decades was unexpectedly somewhat high in Finland in about 20,000 owls, where it was 33% in the 1st year, 64% in 2nd year, 73% in subsequent years.  ",1
5355,"In England, it was estimated that there was 6-11 times lower survival rate for tawny owls that were ragiotagged than for those that were not based on estimates, the theory as to why it lower survival is that the additional weight burden of the radio-tags themselves may have inhibited capture of food and also made juveniles more vulnerable to goshawks.  Helminths are also fairly common and may compromise the condition of many owls, if rarely the cause of direct fatalities.  Parasites commonly recorded in tawny owls including Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma, Centrorhynchus and Tetrameres, with different species of Leucocytozoon present in about 95% of 32 individuals in Great Britain and  57% of study specimens in Italy.     ",1
5356,Haemoptroteus was the prevalent parasites in France and also quite prominent in birds from Turkey.   ,1
5357,The first records of Trichinella were recorded recently in Europe as well as the similarly rare Eimeria.   ,1
5358,Blood parasitism was more common in England when food supplies were lowered.   ,1
5359,"In some cases, parasites are contracted directly from their prey.  It was estimated that about 25% of free-living adults in England had some variety of ocular lesions, which may lead to cases of bacterial infections and conjunctiva.  Concentrations of Enterobacteriaceae, which can be fatal to humans, are sometimes found in nest boxes.  ",1
5360,"The tawny owl is a common bird, especially in central Europe.  ",1
5361,"The tawny owl has a geographical range of at least 10 million km2 (3.8 million mi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000â2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone with more extensive surveys two decades later.   Population trends have not been quantified, but there is evidence of an overall increase. ",1
5362,This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern.   ,1
5363,"Globally, the population may be estimated anywhere from 1 million to nearly 3 million individuals.  50% of European numbers were in the nations of Germany, France, Poland, Italy and Russia.   ",1
5364,In the UK it is on the RSPB Amber List of Concern.  ,1
5365,"In Great Britain, estimated number there in the 1970s ran up to 100,000 pairs whereas more recent estimate suggest much fewer, at about 20,000 pairs.  ",1
5366,"Although estimates are variable, close study has shown a population reduction of fairly nebulous cause in Britain of around 11% from 1968-1972 to 1988-1991 or of an estimated 6% from 1970 to 2010, utilizing two different surveying methods.    Relative to the loss of other British woodland birds, which has been pronounced, the tawny owl reductions may be considered small to moderate. ",1
5367,"Among myriad and complex causes for all forest birds in Britain, for the tawny owl it is mentioned that competition for nest sites with introduced eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) may be responsible for some of the reductions.  ",1
5368,"The French population of tawny owls is very large and increased in estimated numbers from 10,000-100,000 in the early 1970s to 50,000-150,000 estimated in the 1990s.  5 digit numbers are estimated in many European countries, including Germany, Italy, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Greece, Croatia, European Russia and Belarus.  ",1
5369,"It is thought that declines may have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Albania and even Italy.  ",1
5370,"The estimated number of breeding pairs within Denmark using different calculation methods was very variable with different estimates from 4800 to 7400 to 20,500.  ",1
5371,"A large number were estimated in Turkey, perhaps up to an estimated 25,000 pairs, with Syria estimated up to 50 pairs and 250 pairs roughly in Israel.   ",1
5372,"While tawny owls may commonly use nest boxes, these are not considered necessary given the general stability of the population.  Increased populations pose a risk to smaller owls in areas of sympatry and may hamper conservation efforts of such species.   ",1
5373,"Besides natural causes such as predation and starvation, collision with vehicles, power lines, any other kind of wire collision and other manmade objects is a regular cause of tawny owl mortality.   ",1
5374,"Occasionally, the species is exposed to assorted forms of human persecution (from egg-collecting to shootings and poisonings) but it is not nearly as extensively persecuted as larger birds like golden eagles, goshawks and eagle owls. ",0
5375,"However, earlier in the 20th century, as many as 12% of birds recovered in Scandivania were dead from various forms of persecution.     ",1
5376,"Although they are fairly adaptable to urbanization, there are limits to the tawny owls adaptability, especially due to declines in woodland quality, prey access and human-sourced mortality sources, one of the worst of which is collision with vehicles.   ",1
5377,"Of 112 tawny owls re-released in the wild from England's East Winch Wildlife Centre, 17% were subsequently recovered (about half of which were dead), with the most diagnosed cause of mishap being road accidents.  ",1
5378,"Of 57 tawny owls released in Somerset and Hampshire, 28% were recovered dead.  ",1
5379,"However, tawny owls, perhaps due to their liking of wooded rather open areas, are relatively less vulnerable to automobile deaths than some other owls, i.e. of hundreds dead owls on roadsides in Italy, only 4.5% were tawnys, while 41% were little owls and 39% barn owls, while in Germany, 7.4% were tawnys, against 53% barn owls and 28.4% little owls.  Variable levels of occular damage, with comparable levels of ocular trauma to humans who are victims of car collisions, were detected in 50 tawny owls in England recovered after surviving car collisions.  ",1
5380,"Damage to the occular area was recorded in 128 of 216 free-living tawnys in southwest England, and in 60.5% of 147 admitted birds the injury were due to road accidents.  ",1
5381,"In the forest of Burgundy, road-based deaths were the main cause of mortality that could be diagnosed.  Roadkills of tawny owls were fairly frequent in Portugal, but were not usually in prime habitat and often occurred near the borders of existing territories.  ",1
5382,"However, density was reduced by road development in Portuguese owls, largely due to the fragmentation of habitat, disturbance and  noise pollution that may effect intraspecific communication and hunting and increase mortality may come with major roads for owls.  ",1
5383,"Similarly, in Germany, despite the general adaptability to development in tawny owls, locally the noise pollution and increased fragmentation of woods was found to be reducing tawny owl populations.  ",1
5384,An unclear number of tawny owls may be killed by heavy metal contamination via bioaccumulation as well as via pesticide use.   ,1
5385,"Lead levels were difficult to estimate in Spanish owls due to the large number of feathers needed to estimate them, while dead Spanish owls had middling, variable levels of mercury concentrations.    ",1
5386,"In eggs from Norway, polyfluoroalkyl compounds were studied, in sum toxicological implications were low and several times lower than would be implied by the diversity of compounds found in the eggs.  British birds appear to be effected by second-generation anticoagulants, with about 20% of 192 birds showing detectable residues of these. ",1
5387,"The number is lower than other raptors analyzed here such as common kestrel, barn owl, common buzzard and red kite and the number of tawnys did not perceptibly decline due to this.  ",1

5393,Terns are treated as a subgroup of the family Laridae which includes gulls and skimmers and consist of eleven genera. ,0
5394,"They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. ",0
5395,"Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. ",0

5407,The eggs of two species are eaten in the West Indies because they are believed to have aphrodisiac properties. ,0
5408,The bird order Charadriiformes contains 18 coastal seabird and wader families. ,0
5409,"Within the order, the terns form a lineage with the gulls, and, less closely, with the skimmers, skuas, and auks.   Early authors such as Conrad Gessner, Francis Willughby, and William Turner did not clearly separate terns from gulls,  but ",1
5410,"Linnaeus recognised the distinction in his 1758 Systema Naturae, placing the gulls in the genus  Larus and the terns in Sterna. ",0
5411,"He gave Sterna the description rostrum subulatum, ""awl-shaped bill"", referring to the long, pointed bills typical of this group of birds, a feature that distinguishes them from the thicker-billed gulls.    ",1
5412,"Behaviour and morphology suggest that the terns are more closely related to the gulls than to the skimmers or skuas, and although Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the family Sternidae for the terns in 1838, for many years they were considered to be a subfamily, Sterninae, of the gull family, Laridae. ",0
5413,"Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other Charadriiformes, were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and the misidentification of some finds.   Following genetic research in the early twenty-first century, the terns were historically treated as a separate family: ",1
5414,"Most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus, Sterna, with just a few dark species placed in other genera; in 1959, only the noddies and the Inca tern were excluded from Sterna.   ",1
5415,A recent analysis of DNA sequences supported the splitting of Sterna into several smaller genera.   ,1
5416,One study of part of the cytochrome b gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of waders in the suborder Thinocori.  ,1
5417,"These results are in disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies, and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular convergent evolution between the terns and these waders, or the retention of an ancient genotype.  ",1
5418,"The word ""stearn"" was used for these birds in Old English as early as the eighth century, and appears in the poem The Seafarer, written in the ninth century or earlier. ",0
5419,"Variants such as ""tearn"" occurred by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in Norfolk dialect for several centuries.  ",1
5420,"As now, the term was used for the inland black tern as well as the marine species.   ",1
5421,"Some authorities consider ""tearn"" and similar forms to be variants of ""stearn"",  while others derive the English words from Scandinavian equivalents such as Danish and Norwegian terne or Swedish taÌrna, and ultimately from Old Norse Ã3⁄4erna.   Linnaeus adopted ""stearn"" or ""sterna"" (which the naturalist William Turner had used in 1544 as a Latinisation of an English word, presumably ""stern"", for the black tern)   or a North Germanic equivalent for his genus name Sterna.  ",1
5422,"The cladogram shows the relationships between the tern genera, and the currently recognised species, based on mitochondrial DNA studies, are listed below:  Anous Gygis Onychoprion Sternula Phaetusa Phaetusa Gelochelidon Hydroprogne Chlidonias Thalasseus Sterna ",1
5423,"In addition to extant species, the fossil record includes a Miocene palaeospecies ",0
5424,"The genera Anous, Procelsterna and Gygis are collectively known as noddies, the Chlidonias species are the marsh terns,  and all other species comprise the sea terns.   ",1
5425,"Terns range in size from the least tern, at 23 cm (9.1 in) in length and weighing 30â45 g (1.1â1.6 oz),   to the Caspian tern at 48â56 cm (19â22 in), 500â700 g ",1
5426,"They are longer-billed, lighter-bodied, and more streamlined than gulls, and their long tails and long narrow wings give them an elegance in flight. ",0
5427,"Male and female plumages are identical, although the male can be 2â5% larger than the female and often has a relatively larger bill. ",0
5428,"Sea terns have deeply forked tails, and at least a shallow ""V"" is shown by all other species.  ",1
5429,"The noddies (genera Anous, Procelsterna and Gygis) have unusual notched-wedge shaped tails, the longest tail feathers being the middle-outer, rather than the central or outermost.   ",1
5430,"They rarely swim, despite having webbed feet, usually landing on water only to bathe.  ",1
5431,"The majority of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, with a black cap to the head. ",0
5432,"The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. ",0
5433,"The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. ",0
5434,"When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. ",0
5435,"The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. ",0
5436,The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. ,0
5437,"The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, but it has been suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird.  Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.  ",1
5438,"Juvenile terns typically have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges that give the plumage a scaly appearance. ",0
5439,"In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. ",0
5440,"By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. ",0
5441,"After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. ",0
5442,Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls.  ,1
5443,"For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also used as a warning to intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. ",0
5444,"Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact.  Parents and chicks can locate one another by call,  and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.   Vocal differences reinforce species separation between closely related birds such as the least and little terns,  and can help humans distinguish similar species, such as common and Arctic terns, since flight calls are unique to each species.   ",1
5445,"Terns have a worldwide distribution, breeding on all continents including Antarctica. ",0
5446,The northernmost and southernmost breeders are the Arctic tern and Antarctic tern respectively.   ,1
5447,"Many terns breeding in temperate zones are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern probably sees more annual daylight than any other animal as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds to Antarctic waters, a return journey of more than 30,000 km (19,000 mi). ",0
5448,"A common tern that hatched in Sweden and was found dead five months later on Stewart Island, New Zealand, must have flown at least 25,000 km (16,000 mi).  ",1
5449,"Actual flight distances are, of course, much greater than the shortest possible route. ",0
5450,"Arctic terns from Greenland were shown by radio geolocation to average 70,000 km (43,000 mi) on their annual migrations.  ",1
5451,Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky areas on coasts and islands. ,0
5452,"The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also sometimes use inland locations. ",0
5453,"The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. ",0
5454,The black noddy and the white tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. ,0
5455,"Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. ",0
5456,"The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land for up to five years after fledging until they return to breed. ",0
5457,"They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. ",0
5458,"Terns are normally monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings have been observed in at least three species.   ",1
5459,"Most terns breed annually and at the same time of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. ",0
5460,"Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. ",0
5461,"Some large sea terns, including the sooty and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. ",0
5462,"Terns normally breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. ",0
5463,"A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers.  ",1
5464,"Large tern species tend to form larger colonies,  which in the case of the sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs. ",1
5465,"Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. ",0
5466,Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.  ,1
5467,"The male selects a territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. ",0
5468,"Courtship involves ritualised flight and ground displays, and the male often presents a fish to his partner. ",0
5469,"Most species have little or no nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. ",0
5470,"Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces.   ",1
5471,"The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin.  ",1
5472,The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.  ,1
5473,"Tropical species usually lay just one egg, but two or three is typical in cooler regions if there is an adequate food supply. ",0
5474,"The time taken to complete the clutch varies, but for temperate species incubation takes 21â28 days.  ",1
5475,"The eggs of most gulls and terns are brownwith dark splotches, so they are difficult for predators to spot on the beach.  ",1
5476,"Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner.  ",1
5477,"Terns are generally long-lived birds, with individuals typically returning for 7â10 breeding seasons. ",0
5478,Maximum known ages include 34 for an Arctic tern and 32 for a sooty. ,0
5479,"Although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years, their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because the birds can outlive their rings.  ",1
5480,"Interbreeding between tern species is rare, and involves closely related species when it occurs. ",0
5481,"Hybrids recorded include common tern with roseate, Sandwich with lesser-crested, and black with white-winged.  ",1
5482,"Most terns hunt fish by diving, often hovering first, and the particular approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance.  Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. ",1
5483,"Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed to sleep on the wing since they become waterlogged easily. ",0
5484,"Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats.  ",1
5485,The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. ,0
5486,Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises.  ,1
5487,"The gull-billed tern is an opportunist predator, taking a wide variety of prey from marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. ",0
5488,"Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. ",0
5489,"Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims.    ",1
5490,"The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.  ",1
5491,"The eyes of terns cannot accommodate under water, so they rely on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive.  ",1
5492,"Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas;  birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species.  ",1
5493,"The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions,  and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds.  ",1
5494,"The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls,  and this protects the eye from UV damage.  ",1
5495,"The inaccessibility of many tern colonies gave them a measure of protection from mammalian predators, especially on islands, but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. ",0
5496,"These can be predators such as foxes, raccoons, cats and rats, or animals that destroy the habitat, including rabbits, goats and pigs.  ",1
5497,"Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien carnivore, such as the American mink in Scotland, presents an unfamiliar threat.  Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, and their chicks and eggs may be taken by herons, crows or gulls.   Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies.   ",1
5498,"Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.   ",1
5499,"External parasites include chewing lice of the genus Saemundssonia,  feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis.  Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite different species.  Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis and members of the genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus.  ",1
5500,"Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. ",0
5501,"An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus.  ",1
5502,"In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds.  ",1
5503,Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.  ,1
5504,Terns and their eggs have long been eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily obtained source of protein. ,0
5505,"Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. ",0
5506,"The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. ",0
5507,"In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns are believed to be aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. ",0
5508,"Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity in the second half of the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. ",0
5509,This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. ,0
5510,"White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.   ",1
5511,"Terns have sometimes benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. ",0
5512,"Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could lead them to fish shoals. ",0
5513,Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. ,0
5514,"More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species.  ",1
5515,"Pollution has been a problem in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. ",0
5516,"In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US.  ",1
5517,"Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.  ",1
5518,"Habitat enhancements used to increase the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns,    and artificial islands created for a number of different species.   More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation,  and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.  ",1
5519,"A number of terns face serious threats, and the Chinese crested tern is classed as ""critically endangered"" by BirdLife International. ",0
5520,It has a population of fewer than 50 birds and a breeding range of just 9 km2 (3.5 mi2). ,0
5521,"It is declining due to egg collection, human disturbance and the loss of coastal wetlands in China.  ",1
5522,"Three other species are categorised as ""endangered"", with declining populations of less than 10,000 birds. ",0
5523,"The South Asian black-bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss, egg collecting for food, pollution and predation.  ",1
5524,"In New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and Australian magpies. ",0
5525,Disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor.  ,1
5526,"The Peruvian tern was initially damaged by the collapse of anchoveta stocks in 1972, but breeding colonies have subsequently been lost due to building, disturbance and pollution in their coastal wetlands.  ",1
5527,"Disturbance by humans, dogs and vehicles, predation by introduced species and inappropriate water level management in South Australia are the main reasons for its decline.  Five species are ""near threatened"", indicating less severe concerns or only potential vulnerability. ",1
5528,"The elegant tern is so categorised because 95% of the population breeds on one island, Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California, and the Kerguelen tern has a population of less than 5,000 adults breeding on small and often stormy Pacific islands.   ",1
5529,"Three species, the Inca, Damara, and river terns, are expected to decline in the future due to habitat loss and disturbance.    ",1
5530,"Some tern subspecies are endangered, including the California least tern and the Easter Island race of the grey noddy.  Most tern species are declining in numbers due to the loss or disturbance of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. ",1
5531,"Gull populations have increased over the last century because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. ",0
5532,"A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.  ",1
5533,Terns are protected by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. [89 ,1
5534,] Parties to the AWEA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. ,0
5535,"The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.  ",1
5536,"The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.[91Hirundo bicolor Vieillot, 1808Iridoprocne bicolor Coues, 1878 ",0
5537,The tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is a migratory bird of the family Hirundinidae. ,0
5538,"Found in the Americas, the tree swallow was first described in 1807 by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot as Hirundo bicolor. ",0
5539,"It has since been moved to its current genus, Tachycineta, within which its phylogenetic placement is debated. ",0
5540,"The tree swallow has glossy blue-green upperparts, with the exception of the blackish wings and tail, and white underparts. ",0
5541,"The bill is black, the eyes dark brown, and the legs and feet pale brown. ",0
5542,"The female is generally duller than the male, and the first-year female has mostly brown upperparts, with some blue feathers. ",0
5543,"It winters along southern US coasts south, along the Gulf Coast, to Panama and the northwestern coast of South America, and in the West Indies. ",0
5544,"The tree swallow nests either in isolated pairs or loose groups, in both natural and artificial cavities. ",0
5545,"Breeding can start as soon as early May, although this date is occurring earlier because of climate change, and it can end as late as July. ",0
5546,"This bird is generally socially monogamous (although about 8% of males are polygynous), with high levels of extra-pair paternity. ",0
5547,"This can benefit the male, but since the female controls copulation, the lack of resolution on how this behaviour benefits females makes the high level of extra-pair paternity puzzling. ",0
5548,The female incubates the clutch of two to eight (but usually four to seven) pure white eggs for around 14 to 15 days. ,0
5549,"The chicks hatch slightly asynchronously, allowing the female to prioritize which chicks to feed in times of food shortage. ",0
5550,"The tree swallow is sometimes considered a model organism, due to the large amount of research done on it. ",0
5551,"An aerial insectivore, the tree swallow forages both alone and in groups, eating mostly insects, in addition to molluscs, spiders, and fruit. ",0
5552,"The nestlings, like the adult, primarily eat insects, fed to it by both sexes. ",0
5553,"This swallow is vulnerable to parasites, but, when on nestlings, these do little damage. ",0
5554,"The effect of disease can become stronger as a tree swallow gets older, as some parts of the immune system decline with age. ",0
5555,"Acquired T cell-mediated immunity, for example, decreases with age, whereas both innate and acquired humoral immunity do not. ",0
5556,"Because of its large range and stable population, the tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ",0
5557,"In the US, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. ",0
5558,"This swallow is negatively affected by human activities, such as the clearing of forests; acidified lakes can force a breeding tree swallow to go long distances to find calcium-rich food items to feed to its chicks. ",0
5559,"The tree swallow was described as Hirundo bicolor by Louis Pierre Vieillot in his Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'AmeÌrique Septentrionale, published in 1807.  ",1
5560,It was then placed in its current genus Tachycineta when Jean Cabanis established it in 1850.  ,1
5561,"In 1878, Elliott Coues suggested that the tree swallow, at the very least, be put in its own subgenus, Iridoprocne, on the basis of its plumage, along with the white-winged swallow, Chilean swallow, white-rumped swallow, and mangrove swallow.  ",1
5562,"Some authors continued to use this classification, with the addition of Tumbes swallow; however, genetic evidence supports the existence of a single genus, Tachycineta.  ",1
5563,The tree swallow is also called the white-bellied swallow for its white underparts.  ,1
5564,"The generally accepted genus name is from Ancient Greek takhykinetos, ""moving quickly"", and the specific bicolor is Latin and means ""two-coloured"".  ",1
5565,"The other genus name, Iridoprocne, comes from the Greek iris, meaning rainbow, and Procne, a figure who supposedly turned into a swallow.  How exactly the tree swallow is related to other members of Tachycineta is unresolved. ",1
5566,"In studies based on mitochondrial DNA, it was placed basal (meaning it was the first offshoot in the species tree) within the North American-Caribbean clade consisting of the violet-green swallow, golden swallow, and Bahama swallow.   ",1
5567,"Although mitochondrial DNA is advocated as a better indicator of evolutionary changes because it evolves quickly, analyses based on it can suffer because it is only inherited from the mother, making it worse than nuclear DNA from multiple loci at representing the phylogeny of a whole group.  ",1
5568,A study based on such nuclear DNA placed the tree swallow in the most basal position within Tachycineta as a whole (as a sister group to the rest of the genus).  ,1
5569,The tree swallow has a length between about 12 and 14 cm (4.7 and 5.5 in) and a weight of approximately 17 to 25.5 g (0.60 to 0.90 oz). ,0
5570,"The male has mostly glossy blue-green upperparts, the wings and tail being blackish. ",0
5571,"The underparts  and the cheek patch are white,  although the underwing coverts are grey-brown.  ",1
5572,"The bill is black, the eyes dark brown, and the legs and feet pale brown.  ",1
5573,"The female is duller in colour than the male, and sometimes has a brown forehead.  ",1
5574,"The second-year  female also has brown upperparts, with a variable number of blue feathers; some third-year females also retain a portion of this subadult plumage.  ",1
5575,"According to a 1987 study, this likely allows a younger female to explore nest sites, as the resident male is usually less aggressive to a subadult female.  A 2013 study found that the resident female was less aggressive towards second-year female models when they were presented separately from older models. ",1
5576,"Why the female eventually replaces its subadult plumage is unknown; it may allow males to assess female quality, as pairs mate assortatively based on plumage brightness.  ",1
5577,"The juvenile tree swallow can be distinguished by its brown upperparts and grey-brown-washed breast.[14The tree swallow's song consists of three parts: the chirp, the whine, and the gurgle. ",0
5578,"These sections may be repeated or omitted, and all can stand alone. ",0
5579,"The first, as the chirp call (sometimes divided into the contact call and solicitation call), is made by the female during copulation  and in both sexes to stimulate the nestlings to beg  or (in some populations) when their mate leaves or enters the next cavity. ",1
5580,"The whine, generally consisting of a downward shift in frequency followed by an upward shift, may be given alone as the anxiety call,  occasionally made in response to certain predators.  ",1
5581,"The gurgle, as when it appears at the end of the song, is usually uttered twice. ",0
5582,"The chatter call is used to advertise nest sites (the reason it is also known as the ""nest-site advertising call"") and is also given to intruding conspecifics. ",0
5583,A short high-pitched submission call is sometimes uttered after an aggressive encounter with another tree swallow. ,0
5584,"While being physically restrained or in pain, a distress call may be given. ",0
5585,"The male often utters a ticking (or rasping) aggression call during copulation, and both sexes use it at the end of mobbing dives. ",0
5586,"The alarm call is given in reaction to predators and other intruders,  and can serve to induce older nestlings to crouch and stop begging when a predator is near.  ",1
5587,Communication between parents and offspring can be disrupted by human-generated noise. ,0
5588,"A 2014 study, for example, found that broods for whom white noise was played were less likely to crouch or stop begging in response to alarm calls. ",0
5589,"Parents did not alter their calls to compensate, likely increasing predation risk.  ",1
5590,"Noise can also disrupt whether parents respond to begging, but this may be balanced out by the louder calls nestlings give when exposed to it. ",0
5591,"Increased begging effort, however, may be ineffective or costly for louder levels of noise.  ",1
5592,Its range extends to north-central Alaska and up to the tree line in Canada. ,0
5593,"It is found as far south as Tennessee in the eastern part of its range, California and New Mexico in the west, and Kansas in the centre. ",0
5594,"It occasionally breeds further south in the US,  and vagrants are sometimes found in the Arctic Circle, the northern Pacific, Greenland, and Europe.  ",1
5595,"The wintering range is from California and southwestern Arizona in the west and southeastern Virginia in the east south along the Gulf Coast to the West Indies, Panama, and the northwestern South American coast.  ",1
5596,"While migrating, this swallow often uses stop-over sites, spending an average of 57 days at these areas during autumn. ",0
5597,"To get to its wintering range, it often uses one of three flyways: the Western flyway, west of the Rocky Mountains; the Central flyway, between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, stretching south into Eastern Mexico; and the Eastern flyway, from the Great Lakes east.  ",1
5598,"When a swallow returns to nest, it usually does not change breeding sites.  ",1
5599,"The breeding habitat of this bird is primarily in open and wooded areas, especially those near water.  ",1
5600,"It roosts every night during the non-breeding season, preferring to rest in cane or reed beds over water, but it is also found over land and on trees and wires. ",0
5601,Roosting sites are generally 100 to 150 kilometres (62 to 93 mi) apart.  ,1
5602,"Because of the large amount of research on the tree swallow and how it willingly breeds in nest boxes, biologist Jason Jones recommended that it be considered a model organism.  ",1
5603,"Although it is aggressive during the breeding season, this swallow is sociable outside of it, forming flocks sometimes numbering thousands of birds.  ",1
5604,"The tree swallow nests in structures with pre-existing holes, both natural and artificial. ",0
5605,"These were once found only in forested regions, but the building of nest boxes has allowed this bird to expand into open habitats.  ",1
5606,This swallow usually nests in the area it bred the year before; only about 14% of females and 4% of males disperse to breed at a new site per year. ,0
5607,"Most do not go far, usually breeding at sites less than 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) away from their original grounds. ",0
5608,"Dispersal is influenced by breeding success; of the adult females that fail to fledge a chick, about 28% disperse, compared to 5% of successful breeders.  ",1
5609,Natal dispersal (when a bird does not return to the site it was born at to breed) is common in the tree swallow and occurs more frequently than breeding dispersal.  ,1
5610,"When nesting in loose groups, nests are usually spaced at least 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49 ft) apart,  and those that are closer in distance are usually further apart in terms of laying date.  ",1
5611,"In natural cavities, the tree swallow nests about 27 metres (89 ft) apart from its neighbor. ",0
5612,"The nest hole in these situations is, on average, 3.4 metres (11 ft) above ground level, although about 45% of them are less than 2 metres (6.6 ft) above the ground. ",0
5613,"Higher cavities are likely favoured because they reduce predation, while lower nest holes may be chosen to avoid competition. ",0
5614,"Entrance widths are often between 4 and 5 centimetres (1.6 and 2.0 in), whereas entrance heights are more variable: a 1989 study found openings ranging from 3.5 to 26 centimetres (1.4 to 10.2 in). ",0
5615,"Cavity volume is generally below 1,000 cubic centimetres (61 cu in).  After finding a suitable place to nest, the male perches near it and calls frequently. ",1
5616,"A lack of sites can cause fights between birds, sometimes resulting in deaths. ",0
5617,"This swallow usually defends an area around the nest with a radius of about 4.6 metres (15 ft),  as well as extra nests inside of that territory,  by blocking the entrance to the nest and chasing intruders.  ",1
5618,"The nest cup itself is made from grass, moss, pine needles, and aquatic plants collected mostly by the female,  and is lined with feathers gathered primarily by the male in fights.  ",1
5619,"The feathers may function to insulate the nest, decreasing incubation time  and likely preventing hypothermia in chicks. ",1
5620,"In addition to faster growth for chicks,  eggs cool slower in nests with feathers than those without.  ",1
5621,"However, a study published in 2018 did not find a significant correlation between the number of feathers in nests that were artificially warmed versus those that were not. ",0
5622,"Additionally, it found that nests in St. Denis, Saskatchewan used significantly less feathers than those in Annapolis Valley, despite the former being further north. ",0
5623,"However, temperatures in Nova Scotia (where Annapolis Valley is) are generally lower than those in Saskatchewan, possibly explaining the unexpected result.  ",1
5624,"This can be stimulated through wing-fluttering flight by the female, which may be an invitation to court. ",0
5625,"The male may then take a vertical posture, with a raised and slightly spread tail and wings flicked and slightly drooped. ",0
5626,"This prompts the female to try to land on the male's back, but he flies to prevent this; this is repeated. ",0
5627,"After courting the female, the male flies to his chosen nest site, which the female inspects. ",0
5628,"During copulation, the male hovers over the female, and then mounts her, giving ticking calls. ",0
5629,He then makes cloacal contact with the female while holding her neck feathers in his bill and standing on her slightly outstretched wings. ,0
5630,"Copulation occurs multiple times.  Eggs are laid from early May to mid-June (although this is happening earlier due to climate change ) and chicks fledge between mid-June and July.  Latitude is positively correlated with laying date,  while female age and wing length (longer wings allow more efficient foraging ) are negatively correlated.  ",1
5631,"The tree swallow is likely an income breeder, as it breeds based on food abundance and temperatures during the laying season.  ",1
5632,"This species is generally socially monogamous, but up to 8% of breeding males are polygynous.[14 ",0
5633,] Polygyny is influenced by territory: males having territories with nest boxes at least 5 metres (16 ft) apart are more likely to be polygynous.  ,1
5634,"It is suggested that this polygyny depends on the conditions during the laying season: better conditions, such as an abundance of food, allow females in polygyny who do not receive help foraging to lay more eggs.  ",1
5635,"The tree swallow has high rates of extra-pair paternity, 38% to 69% of nestlings being a product of extra-pair paternity, and 50% to 87% of broods containing at least one nestling that was the result of an extra-pair copulation.  ",1
5636,"One factor that might contribute to this is that females have control over copulation, making paternity guards ineffective.  ",1
5637,"This may be mitigated by more frequent copulations just before egg laying, according to a 2009 study which found that within-pair copulation attempts peaked three to one days before the first egg was laid and that more successful attempts during this period increased the share of within-pair young males had. ",0
5638,This latter finding contradicts those of a 1993 and a 1994 study.  Extra-pair paternity does not change the level of parental care the male contributes in the tree swallow.  ,1
5639,A significant number of extra-pair fathers may be floaters (those present at breeding grounds that presumably do not breed). ,0
5640,"A 2001 study found that out of 35 extra-pair nestlings, 25 were sired by local residents, three by residents of nearby sites, and seven by male floaters. ",0
5641,"In the tree swallow, floating thus helps males in good condition produce more chicks, while allowing males in bad condition to be successful by investing in parental care.  ",1
5642,"There is also a significant population of female floaters; a 1985 study estimated that around 23% to 27% of females were floaters, of which about 47% to 79% were subadults.  ",1
5643,Why females engage in extra-pair copulation and how they choose extra-pair mates is controversial. ,0
5644,"One theory, called the genetic compatibility hypothesis, states that increased offspring fitness results from increased heterozygosity, and thus that female tree swallows would prefer to mate with males that are less genetically similar to them. ",0
5645,Females may also choose sperm after copulation to ensure a compatible mate. ,0
5646,"In support of this theory, a 2007 study found that extra-pair offspring were more heterozygous than within-pair offspring.  ",1
5647,"However, a 2005 paper discovered a slight negative correlation between a pair's genetic similarity and the proportion of extra-pair young in their nest.  ",1
5648,The good genes theory says that females choose extra-pair males based on the quality of their genes. ,0
5649,"This would explain why some tree swallows do not have any extra-pair young, whereas others do.  ",1
5650,"However, most studies have not found phenotypic differences between extra-pair and within-pair males (although a 2007 study did find that older males with brighter plumage were more likely to mate outside of the pair bond).  ",1
5651,"Additionally, according to a 2017 thesis, extra-pair offspring are no more likely to join their natal population than within-pair offspring. ",0
5652,"Another theory suggests that extra-pair paternity is context dependent, with extra-pair young outperforming within-pair young in certain situations, and underperforming in other environments. ",0
5653,"A 2017 dissertation, for example, found that extra-pair young were larger, heavier, and longer-winged than within-pair young when both were exposed to predator mounts, while within-pair young were heavier than extra-pair young when they were shown non-predator mounts. ",0
5654,"This thesis also found that within-pair young outperformed extra-pair young in terms of life-time fitness when they were raised in less-variable environments, suggesting that extra-pair offspring have less developmental plasticity than within-pair offspring.  ",1
5655,"A 2018 study weakly supported this context dependent hypothesis, finding that extra-pair offspring were more likely to fledge than within-pair offspring in experimentally enlarged broods; however, neither telomere length (a correlate of survival and reproductive success) nor size 12 days after hatching were significantly different among these young, and no significant differences between the two types were found in non-enlarged broods.  Studies attempting to prove the adaptability of extra-pair paternity for females have been criticized for the lack of positive effect that increased offspring fitness would have when compared with the potential cost of decreased fitness for the female,  such as increased predation from searching for mates.  ",1
5656,"Thus, theories based on the non-adaptivity of extra-pair paternity for females have been postulated. ",0
5657,"These theories are based on genetic constraint, where an allele resulting in a maladaptive behaviour is maintained because it also contributes to a beneficial phenotype. ",0
5658,The theory of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy says that strong selection for extra-pair paternity in males (as seen in this bird ) overrides the weak selection against extra-pair paternity in females. ,1
5659,"The hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, meanwhile, argues that extra-pair paternity is present because the genes regulating it have pleiotropic effects on aspects of female fitness,  like within-pair copulation rate.  ",1
5660,"The tree swallow lays a clutch of two to eight, although usually four to seven,  pure white, and translucent at laying, eggs that measure about 19 by 14 millimetres (0.75 by 0.55 in).  ",1
5661,"These eggs are incubated by the female,  usually after the second-to-last egg is laid,  for 11 to 20 days,  although most hatch after 14 to 15 days. ",1
5662,"About 88% of nests produce at least one nestling, but this can be lowered by poor weather and a younger breeding female.  ",1
5663,"They also hatch slightly asynchronously, with an average of 28 hours between when the first and final nestling emerges. ",0
5664,"This can result in a weight hierarchy where earlier-hatched chicks weigh more (especially early in the nestling period) than those hatched later, allowing the female to prioritize which chick to give food to during food shortages. ",0
5665,"This likely has its greatest effect early in the nestling period, as by 12 days after hatching, there are generally no significant weight differences.  Infanticide of the chicks and eggs sometimes occurs when a male is replaced by another male. ",1
5666,"Infanticide usually does not occur when the clutch is not complete, as replacement males then have a chance to fertilize at least one egg. ",0
5667,"When the male arrives during incubation, it sometimes commits infanticide, but other times adopts the eggs, as there is a chance that some eggs were sired from the replacement male. ",0
5668,"If the replacement male arrives after the chicks hatch, infanticide is usually committed, though the female will sometimes prevent this.  ",1
5669,Nests produced by females of better condition often have sex ratios skewed towards high quality males. ,0
5670,"A 2000 study hypothesized this to be because males have more variable reproductive success, and therefore that a high quality male produces more offspring than a female of similar quality.  ",1
5671,The growth and survival of nestling tree swallows is influenced by their environment. ,0
5672,"In both younger and older nestlings (those between two and four days old and between nine and eleven days, respectively) growth is positively influenced by a higher maximum temperature, particularly in the former. ",0
5673,"A later hatching date negatively impacts growth, especially for younger nestlings. ",0
5674,"Growth in younger nestlings increases with age, while in old nestlings, it decreases as they get older.  ",1
5675,"Young tree swallows are able to thermoregulate at least 75% as effectively as the adult at an average age of 9.5 days when out of the nest, and from four to eight days old when in the nest (depending on the size of the brood).  ",1
5676,"The nestlings fledge after about 18 to 22 days, with about 80% fledging success. ",0
5677,"Like hatching success, this is negatively affected by unfavourable weather and a younger female.[14 ",0
5678,The tree swallow forages up to 50 metres (160 ft) above the ground singly or in groups. ,0
5679,"During the breeding season, this is mostly within 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of the nest site. ",0
5680,"When it is foraging for nestlings, though, it usually goes up to 200 metres (660 ft) from the nest,  mostly staying in sight of it, and forages at a height up to 12 metres (39 ft).  As well as being caught in flight,  insects are sometimes taken from the ground, water, vegetation, and vertical surfaces.  ",1
5681,"The tree swallow eats mostly insects, with some molluscs, spiders, and fruit. ",0
5682,"In North America, flies make up about 40% of the diet, supplemented with beetles and ants. ",0
5683,The insects taken are a mix of aquatic and terrestrial organisms; the former is an important source of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids. ,0
5684,"This is because, although the tree swallow can convert the precursor Î±-Linolenic acid into high unsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid, it cannot do so in the quantities needed.  ",1
5685,"The seed and berry food is mainly from the genus Myrica, which is mainly taken in all four of the Northern Hemisphere seasons except summer. ",0
5686,"Crustaceans were also found to be important in the wintering diet in a study on Long Island, New York.  ",1
5687,Both sexes feed the nestlings (although the male feeds the chicks less than the females) resulting in about 10 to 20 feedings per hour.  ,1
5688,The parents often use the chirp call to stimulate nestlings to beg. ,0
5689,"This is used more frequently with younger chicks, as they beg less than older chicks when the parent arrives with food but does not call.  ",1
5690,The likelihood of begging in the absence of parents also increases with age.  ,1
5691,The hatching order affects how much a chick is fed; last-hatched nestlings (in cases where hatching is asynchronous) are likely fed less than those hatched earlier.  ,1
5692,"Nestlings closer to the entrance of the nest are also more likely to be fed, as are those who beg first  and more frequently. ",1
5693,The overall rate at which a brood is fed also increases with more begging.  ,1
5694,"The diet itself is composed mostly of insects, those in the orders Diptera, Hemiptera, and Odonata making up most of the diet.  ",1
5695,"These insects are mostly up to 10 millimetres (0.39 in) in size, but sometimes are up to 60 millimetres (2.4 in) in length.  ",1
5696,"In nests near lakes acidified by humans, calcium supplements, primarily fish bones, crayfish exoskeletons, clam shells, and the shells of bird eggs, are harder to find. ",0
5697,"This forces the adult tree swallow to travel further than usualâsometimes up to 650 metres (2,130 ft) away from the nestâto get these calcium supplements.  ",1
5698,The tree swallow has an average lifespan of 2.7 years  and a maximum of 12 years. ,1
5699,"About 79% of individuals do not survive their first year, and those that do face an annual mortality rate of 40% to 60%.  Most deaths are likely the result of cold weather, which reduces insect availability, leading to starvation.  Lifespan is associated with telomere length: a 2005 study that used return rates (to the breeding site of the previous year) as a proxy for survival found that those with the longest telomeres at one year of age had a predicted lifespan of 3.5 years, compared to the 1.2 years for those with the shortest telomeres.  ",1
5700,Whether short telomeres cause a reduction in fitness or are simply an indicator of it is unknown. ,0
5701,"Regardless, a 2016 thesis found that measures of condition were positively correlated with telomere length. ",0
5702,"Males also generally had longer telomeres than females, as did smaller-winged birds. ",0
5703,"Individuals with shorter telomeres may compensate for potential losses in fitness by increasing reproductive effort, whereas those with longer telomeres may decrease their investment, as evidenced by the smaller proportion of chicks females with longer telomeres fledged.  ",1
5704,"Telomere length is highly heritable, and is especially dependent on that of the mother.  ",1
5705,The tree swallow is susceptible to a wide range of predators. ,0
5706,"Eggs, nestlings, and adults in the nest fall victim to black rat snakes, American crows, American kestrels, common grackles, northern flickers, chipmunks, deermice, domestic cats, weasels,  American black bears,  and raccoons,  ",1
5707,"While flying or perched, predators to the tree swallow include American kestrels, black-billed magpies,  barred owls,  great horned owls, merlins, peregrine falcons, and sharp-shinned hawks. ",1
5708,"Whilst evasive flight is the usual response to predators in free-flying swallows, mobbing behavior is common around the nest,  and is directed not just towards predators, but also towards nest site competitors, who might be scared off by it.  ",1
5709,"This behaviour involves the swallow swarming and diving towards (but not actually striking) the intruder  from around 5 to 20 metres (16 to 66 ft) above the ground, usually giving soft ticking calls near the end and coming within about .5 to 2 metres (1.6 to 6.6 ft) of the predator.  ",1
5710,"It seems to alter the intensity of its attacks based on which predator approaches;  a 1992 study found that ferrets elicited a more vigorous defence than black rat snakes,  and a 2019 thesis similarly discovered that black rat snake models were dived at the least and eastern chipmunk models the most.[77 ",1
5711,] It is suggested that the snake prompted a weaker response because defence behaviours may be less effective  and more dangerous to perform against it.  ,1
5712,"The tree swallow is vulnerable to various parasites, such as the blood parasite Trypanosoma. ",0
5713,"It is also susceptible to the flea Ceratophyllus idius and the feather mites Pteronyssoides tyrrelli, Trouessartia, and (likely) Hemialges. ",0
5714,It is also probably afflicted by lice of the genera Brueelia and Myrsidea. ,0
5715,There is a correlation between the number of fleas on a bird and the number of young it is caring for. ,0
5716,This relationship is speculated to be a cause of an improved microclimate for fleas due to a larger clutch.  ,1
5717,"Nestlings also suffer from parasites, like blow-flies of the genus Protocalliphora,  which results in a loss of blood by nestlings.  ",1
5718,"These parasites, though, are found in a majority of nests and do not seem to have a large effect on nestlings. ",0
5719,A study published in 1992 found that the effects of blow-fly parasitism explained only about 5.5% of the variation in nestling mass.  ,1
5720,"In the breeding female tree swallow, humoral immunocompetence (HIC) is inversely correlated with laying date. ",0
5721,"This means that, on average, a bird that lays its eggs earlier has a stronger antibiotic response to an antigen than a bird that lays later. ",0
5722,A tree swallow that is handicapped by wing-clipping generally has a lower HIC. ,0
5723,"These relationships could be interpreted as supporting the conclusion that a female that lays earlier acquires a higher HIC, but the authors of the study that found the correlations believed this unlikely, due to the colder temperatures near the start of the breeding season. ",0
5724,"Instead, they thought that HIC could be a measure of quality, and that a higher quality female is able to lay earlier. ",0
5725,"The authors also postulated that it is an indicator of workload, as shown by the lower HIC of handicapped birds.  ",1
5726,Higher quality female tree swallows (as measured by laying date) are able to maintain their reproductive effort while diverting resources to fight an immune challenge. ,0
5727,"Lower quality swallows are less able to do so; a 2005 study in Ithaca, New York, found that late-laying females with an artificially enlarged brood, although able to maintain offspring quality, had lower responses to an immune challenge than those that were of higher quality or did not have an enlarged brood.  ",1
5728,"Whether a female chooses to prioritize offspring quality or immunocompetence is likely related to survival probabilities; a 2005 study discovered that females with an enlarged brood in Alaska, where survival rates are lower, had weaker immune responses, but kept reproductive effort steady, whereas those in Tennessee, with higher survival rates, had a stronger response but lower quality offspring.  ",1
5729,"In the tree swallow, some components of the immune system deteriorate with age. ",0
5730,"Acquired T cell-mediated immunity, for example, declines with age in the female tree swallow. ",0
5731,"But, the age of a female does not affect both the acquired and innate humoral immunity; the lack of deterioration in the former contrasts with studies on barn swallows and female collared flycatchers.  ",1
5732,"Because of this immunosenescence (a decrease in immune function with age), older females infected with a disease generally visit their nest less, resulting in their nestlings growing slower. ",0
5733,They are also likely to lose weight because of an infection.  The tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ,1
5734,"This is due to the bird's large range of about 834,000 square kilometres (322,000 sq mi),  and its stable population, estimated to be about 20,000,000 individuals.  ",1
5735,"It is protected in the US by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918,  and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention ",1
5736,"In some parts of the US, the range of this swallow has extended south, likely due to changes in land use, the reintroduction of beavers, and nest boxes installed for bluebirds. ",0
5737,"The tree swallow is negatively impacted by the clearing of forests and the reduction of marshes, the latter reducing the habitat available for wintering. ",0
5738,"This swallow has to compete for nest sites with the common starling, house sparrow (both introduced to North America),  bluebirds,  and the house wren (which also destroys nests without occupying them).  Acidification of lakes can force this swallow to go relatively long distances to find calcium-rich items, and can result in chicks eating plastic.  ",1
5739,"Other chemicals, like pesticides and other pollutants, can become highly concentrated in eggs, and PCBs are associated with the abandonment of a pair's clutch.  Contamination from oil sands mine sites can negatively affect tree swallows by increasing the presence of toxins, as measured by the activity of ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (a detoxification enzyme) in nestlings. ",1
5740,"This normally has little influence on nestling and fledging,  though extreme weather can reveal the effects: a 2006 study found that nestlings from wetlands most polluted by oil sands processing material were more than 10 times more likely to die than those from a control site during periods of synchronized cold temperatures and heavy rainfall, compared to the lack of difference in mortality between the groups when the weather was less extreme.  ",1
5741,"A 2019 paper, however, found that increased precipitation caused a similar decline in hatching and nestling success for nestlings both near and far from oil sands sites.  ",1
5742,"In another study, birds exposed to mercury fledged, on average, one less chick than those not, an effect amplified by warm weather.  ",1
5743,"In addition, cold weather events can rapidly reduce the availability of aerial insect prey,  and in some populations with advancing reproduction may result in reduced offspring survival.[95 ",1
5744,"The trocaz pigeon, Madeira laurel pigeon or long-toed pigeon (Columba trocaz) is a pigeon which is endemic to the island of Madeira. ",0
5745,"It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing markings distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor, the common wood pigeon. ",0
5746,"Its call is a characteristic six-note cooing, weaker and lower-pitched than that of the wood pigeon. ",0
5747,"Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this pigeon has a fast, direct flight. ",0
5748,"A scarce resident breeder in laurisilva forests, the trocaz pigeon lays one white egg in a flimsy twig nest. ",0
5749,"Its numbers fell sharply after human colonisation of the Madeira archipelago, and it vanished altogether from Porto Santo Island. ",0
5750,"The major cause of its population decline was habitat loss from forest clearance, but hunting and nest predation by introduced rats were also contributory factors. ",0
5751,"Protection of the laurel forests and a ban on hunting have enabled numbers to increase, so that the species is no longer endangered. ",0
5752,"The trocaz pigeon is a rather plain, dark grey bird 40â45 cm (15.7â17.7 in) long with a 68â74 cm (26.8â29.1 in) wingspan.  ",1
5753,"The upper back has a violet sheen, becoming green on the back of the neck, and the neck sides are patterned with silver-white. ",0
5754,"The tail is blackish with a wide, pale grey band, and the flight feathers are mainly black. ",0
5755,"The upper breast is pinkish, the eye is yellow, the bill has a yellow tip and a reddish-purple base, and the legs are red. ",0
5756,"The sexes are similar in appearance, but the juvenile has generally browner plumage, with limited or no development of the silvery neck patch. ",0
5757,"Its closed wings have a scaly appearance due to pale buff feather edges. The trocaz pigeon's voice is weaker and deeper than that of common wood pigeon, typically consisting of six syllables with the middle pair of notes extended and stressed: uh-uh hrooh-hrooh ho-ho.  ",1
5758,"When flying, it appears heavy and large-tailed, although its flight is rapid and direct.  ",1
5759,"The common wood pigeon had a poorly defined Madeiran subspecies, Columba palumbus maderensis. ",0
5760,"This was paler than the trocaz pigeon and had white wing patches and a more extensive green iridescence on the nape,  but it became extinct before 1924.  ",1
5761,"Bolle's pigeon is more similar in appearance to the trocaz pigeon, although it lacks the whitish neck patch and has a more extensively pink breast. ",0
5762,"However, that species is endemic to the Canary Islands, so there is no range overlap.  ",1
5763,"The only other pigeon currently present on Madeira is the feral pigeon; this is slimmer, has more pointed wings and a much smaller tail. ",0
5764,"The genus Columba is the largest within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. ",0
5765,"Its members are typically pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. ",0
5766,The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. ,0
5767,"One of several subgroups within Columba consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle's pigeon, the trocaz pigeon, and the African Afep pigeon. ",0
5768,"The two Macaronesian endemic pigeons, Bolle's and trocaz, are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of C. palumbus.  ",1
5769,"The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent. ",0
5770,"The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700,000 years ago.  ",1
5771,"At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. ",0
5772,"Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle's pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya, but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the laurel pigeon, C. junoniae, may date from 20 mya.  ",1
5773,The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Madeira was that which gave rise to the subspecies C. palumbus maderensis.  ,1
5774,"The trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by Karl Heineken, a German medical doctor and ornithologist who was living on Madeira at the time. ",0
5775,"He recognised it as different from the now-extinct local form of the common wood pigeon, which he called the ""Palumbus"", and noted that the two pigeons never interbred or habitually associated together. ",0
5776,"He suggested designating the new species by its local name, ""trocaz"".  Trocaz is a variant of Portuguese torcaz, the common wood pigeon; both words are ultimately derived from the Latin torquis, a collar, and refer to the bird's coloured neck patches.  ",1
5777,"This is a monotypic species, although in the past Bolle's pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the trocaz pigeon.  ",1
5778,"The trocaz pigeon is endemic to the mountainous subtropical Atlantic main island of Madeira, although it formerly also bred on the neighbouring Porto Santo Island. ",0
5779,"It mainly occurs on the northern slopes of the mountains, but smaller numbers are found in the south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain.  ",1
5780,The natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud-covered for much of the year.  ,1
5781,"The forests consist mainly of Azores Laurel, Oreodaphne foetens,  Til, Madeira Mahogany, Canary Laurel, Faya, Lily of the Valley Tree and the Picconia. ",1
5782,"The trocaz pigeon prefers primary forests, but secondary growth is used for feeding, and agricultural land is also visited, especially at times of fruit shortage.  ",1
5783,"Most of the pigeons are found below 1,000 m (3,300 ft), and their prime environment appears to be steep ravine-indented slopes along artificial watercourses, with the occasional large dead laurel tree and much tree heath.  ",1
5784,This species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year.  ,1
5785,"Pigeons can breed from their first year, and nesting occurs throughout the year, although mainly from February to June. ",0
5786,"The displays are similar to those of the common wood pigeon; the male climbs quickly in flight, gives a loud wing-clap, and then glides down with his wings and tail spread. ",0
5787,The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. ,0
5788,"On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again. ",0
5789,"The nest is a typical pigeon construction, a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in a tree in thick forest. ",0
5790,"One, rarely two, smooth white eggs are laid,  although no nest with two chicks has ever been found.  ",1
5791,"The eggs, 3.0â5.0 cm (1.2â2.0 in) in size,  are incubated for 19â20 days; the young are able to fly in 28 days, and are independent within eight weeks.  ",1
5792,"Nearly 60% of its diet is fruit, with most of the rest being leaves, and just 1% is flowers. ",0
5793,"The fruits of Til, Azores Laurel and Persea indica, and the fruits and leaves of Small-leaved Holly are the most frequently detected food items. ",0
5794,"Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact, apart from those of Azores Laurel, which are usually damaged. ",0
5795,"Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter, and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce. ",0
5796,"In one study, 27% of the leaves consumed came from native trees, especially Small-leaved Holly, 61% from herbs and shrubs, and nearly 10% from introduced trees, mainly apples and peaches.  ",1
5797,"This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas, where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant. ",0
5798,"Pigeon faeces from agricultural areas contain few native plants, and samples from forests have few crop species, so some individual birds may concentrate on crops. ",0
5799,"Feeding in cultivated land is commonest in winter, when fruit is readily available, so it appears not to be a shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the forest,  but is mostly opportunistic, resulting from the birds' movements through nearby forest.  Competition for food with rats can be significant in parts of the island.  ",1
5800,The trocaz pigeon formerly bred on both the main island of Madeira and nearby Porto Santo Island. ,0
5801,"It was very abundant when the islands were first colonised by humans, but was extirpated on Porto Santo, and by 1986 had declined to about 2,700 birds. ",0
5802,"Hunting was banned in that year, and there are now between 7,500 and 10,000 individuals in approximately 160 square kilometres (62 sq mi) of suitable habitat. ",0
5803,"The losses on the two islands, the only inhabited ones in the archipelago, were largely the result of deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land.  ",1
5804,The exclusion of livestock from the native forest allows the forest to regenerate and create more suitable habitat. ,0
5805,"Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops, and the government allowed a cull in 2004. ",0
5806,Perhaps the main limiting factor on the rate at which the pigeon increases its numbers is predation by introduced black rats on its eggs and young. ,0
5807,"The Parque Natural da Madeira national park has a management plan for the trocaz pigeon, and it is hoped that an education campaign and the promotion of bird scarers may reduce persecution. ",0
5808,"Its increasing population means that it is now classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988.  ",1
5809,"This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive, and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive.[17  Vultur aura Linnaeus, 1758 ",0
5810,"The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), and in some areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow,  is the most widespread of the New World vultures.  ",1
5811,"One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. ",0
5812,"It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.  ",1
5813,"Like all New World vultures, it is not closely related to the Old World vultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. ",0
5814,The two groups strongly resemble each other because of convergent evolution; natural selection often leads to similar body plans in animals that adapt independently to the same conditions. ,0
5815,The turkey vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion.  ,1
5816,"It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gasses produced by the beginnings of the process of decay in dead animals.  ",1
5817,"In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. ",0
5818,Lacking a syrinxâthe vocal organ of birdsâits only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses.  ,1
5819,"Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation.  ",1
5820,"In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.  ",1
5821,"The turkey vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult's bald red head and its dark plumage to that of the male wild turkey, while the name ""vulture"" is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning ""tearer"", and is a reference to its feeding habits.  ",1
5822,"The word buzzard is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World that term refers to members of the genus Buteo.  ",1
5823,"The turkey vulture was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus as Vultur aura in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, and characterised as ""V. fuscogriseus, remigibus nigris, rostro albo"" (""brown-gray vulture, with black wings and a white beak"").  ",1
5824,"It is a member of the family Cathartidae, along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus Cathartes, along with the greater yellow-headed vulture and the lesser yellow-headed vulture. ",0
5825,"Like other New World vultures, the turkey vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.  ",1
5826,The taxonomic placement of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.  ,1
5827,"Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. ",0
5828,Some earlier authorities suggested that the New World vultures were more closely related to storks.  ,1
5829,"More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures  or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.  ",1
5830,"However, recent genetic studies indicate that neither New World nor Old World vultures are close to falcons, nor are New World vultures close to storks.  ",1
5831,"Both are basal members of the clade Afroaves,  with Old World vultures comprising several groups within the family Accipitridae, also containing eagles, kites, and hawks,   while New World vultures in Cathartiformes are a sister group to Accipitriformes  (containing the osprey and secretarybird along with Accipitridae ). ",1
5832,"A large bird, it has a wingspan of 160â183 cm (63â72 in), a length of 62â81 cm (24â32 in), and weight of 0.8 to 2.41 kg (1.8 to 5.3 lb).     ",1
5833,"Birds in the northern limit of the species' range average larger in size than the vulture from the neotropics. 124 birds from Florida averaged 2 kg (4.4 lb) while 65 and 130 birds from Venezuela were found to average 1.22 and 1.45 kg (2.7 and 3.2 lb), respectively.    ",1
5834,"It displays minimal sexual dimorphism; sexes are identical in plumage and in coloration, and are similar in size.  ",1
5835,"The body feathers are mostly brownish-black, but the flight feathers on the wings appear to be silvery-gray beneath, contrasting with the darker wing linings.  ",1
5836,The adult's head is small in proportion to its body and is red in color with few to no feathers. ,0
5837,"The irises of the eyes are gray-brown; legs and feet are pink-skinned, although typically stained white. ",0
5838,The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.  ,1
5839,The two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases.  ,1
5840,"Tracks are large, between 9.5 and 14 cm (3.7 and 5.5 in) in length and 8.2 and 10.2 cm (3.2 and 4.0 in) in width, both measurements including claw marks. ",0
5841,"The feet are flat, relatively weak, and poorly adapted to grasping; the talons are also not designed for grasping, as they are relatively blunt.  ",1
5842,"The black vulture is relatively shorter-tailed and shorter-winged, which makes it appear rather smaller in flight than the turkey vulture, although the body masses of the two species are roughly the same. ",0
5843,"The nostrils are not divided by a septum, but rather are perforate; from the side one can see through the beak.  ",1
5844,The immature bird has a gray head with a black beak tip; the colors change to those of the adult as the bird matures.  ,1
5845,"As of 2020  there are two captive birds over 45 years old: the Gabbert Raptor Center on the University of Minnesota campus is home to a turkey vulture named Nero with a confirmed hatch year of 1974,  and another male bird, named Lord Richard, lives at the Lindsay Wildlife Experience in Walnut Creek, CA. ",1
5846,Lord Richard hatched in 1974 and arrived at the museum later that year.  ,1
5847,"The oldest wild captured banded bird was 16 years old.  Leucistic (sometimes mistakenly called ""albino"") turkey vultures are sometimes seen.   ",1
5848,"The turkey vulture, like most other vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. ",0
5849,"Because it lacks a syrinx, it can only utter hisses and grunts.  ",1
5850,"It usually hisses when it feels threatened, or when fighting with other vultures over a carcass. ",0
5851,Grunts are commonly heard from hungry young and from adults in their courtship display. ,0
5852,"The turkey vulture has a large range, with an estimated global occurrence of 28,000,000 km2 (11,000,000 sq mi). ",0
5853,"It is the most abundant vulture in the Americas.  Its global population is estimated to be 4,500,000 individuals.  ",1
5854,It is found in open and semi-open areas throughout the Americas from southern Canada to Cape Horn. ,0
5855,"It is a permanent resident in the southern United States, though northern birds may migrate as far south as South America.  ",1
5856,"The turkey vulture is widespread over open country, subtropical forests, shrublands, deserts, and foothills.  ",1
5857,It is most commonly found in relatively open areas which provide nearby woods for nesting and it generally avoids heavily forested areas.  ,1
5858,"This bird with its crow-like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell together with the lesser yellow-headed vulture and the black vulture.  ",1
5859,"The turkey vulture is gregarious and roosts in large community groups, breaking away to forage independently during the day. ",0
5860,"Several hundred vultures may roost communally in groups, which sometimes even include black vultures. ",0
5861,"It roosts on dead, leafless trees, and will also roost on man-made structures such as water or microwave towers. ",0
5862,"Though it nests in caves, it does not enter them except during the breeding season.  ",1
5863,The turkey vulture lowers its night-time body temperature by about 6 degrees Celsius to 34 ,0
5864,"Â°C (93 Â°F), becoming slightly hypothermic.  This vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged or horaltic stance. ",1
5865,"The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. ",0
5866,"This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, by Old World vultures, and by storks.  Like storks, the turkey vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis.  ",1
5867,"It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. The turkey vulture has few natural predators. ",1
5868,"Adult, immature and fledging vultures may fall prey to great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles and bald eagles, while eggs and nestlings may be preyed on by mammals such as raccoons and opossums.      Foxes can occasionally ambush an adult but species that can climb are more likely to breach and predate nests than adults.  ",1
5869,"Its primary form of defense is regurgitating semi-digested meat, a foul-smelling substance, which deters most creatures intent on raiding a vulture nest.  ",1
5870,It will also sting if the predator is close enough to get the vomit in its face or eyes. ,0
5871,"In some cases, the vulture must rid its crop of a heavy, undigested meal to take flight to flee from a potential predator.  ",1
5872,"Its life expectancy in the wild ranges upward of 16 years, with a captive life span of over 45 years being possible.    ",1
5873,"The turkey vulture is awkward on the ground with an ungainly, hopping walk. ",0
5874,"It requires a great deal of effort to take flight, flapping its wings while pushing off the ground and hopping with its feet.  ",1
5875,"While soaring, the turkey vulture holds its wings in a shallow V-shape and often tips from side to side, frequently causing the gray flight feathers to appear silvery as they catch the light. ",0
5876,"The flight of the turkey vulture is an example of static soaring flight, in which it flaps its wings very infrequently, and takes advantage of rising thermals to stay soaring.  ",1
5877,The breeding season of the turkey vulture varies according to latitude.  ,1
5878,"In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June.  ",1
5879,"In more northerly latitudes, the season starts later and extends into August.  ",1
5880,"Courtship rituals of the turkey vulture involve several individuals gathering in a circle, where they perform hopping movements around the perimeter of the circle with wings partially spread. ",0
5881,"In the air, one bird closely follows another while flapping and diving.[43 ",0
5882,"] Eggs are generally laid in the nesting site in a protected location such as a cliff, a cave, a rock crevice, a burrow, inside a hollow tree, or in a thicket. ",0
5883,There is little or no construction of a nest; eggs are laid on a bare surface. ,0
5884,"Females generally lay two eggs, but sometimes one and rarely three. ",0
5885,"The eggs are cream-colored, with brown or lavender spots around their larger end.  ",1
5886,"Both parents incubate, and the young hatch after 30 to 40 days. ",0
5887,"Both adults feed the chicks by regurgitating food for them, and care for them for 10 to 11 weeks. ",0
5888,"When adults are threatened while nesting, they may flee, or they may regurgitate on the intruder or feign death.  ",1
5889,"If the chicks are threatened in the nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating.  ",1
5890,"The turkey vulture feeds primarily on a wide variety of carrion, from small mammals to large grazers, preferring those recently dead, and avoiding carcasses that have reached the point of putrefaction. ",0
5891,"They may rarely feed on plant matter, shoreline vegetation, pumpkin, coconut  and other crops, live insects and other invertebrates.  ",1
5892,"In South America, turkey vultures have been photographed feeding on the fruits of the introduced oil palm.    ",1
5893,"The turkey vulture can often be seen along roadsides feeding on roadkill, or near bodies of water, feeding on washed-up fish.  ",1
5894,"They also will feed on fish or insects that have become stranded in shallow water.  Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion, which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.  ",1
5895,"The turkey vulture forages by smell, an ability that is uncommon in the avian world, often flying low to the ground to pick up the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.  ",1
5896,"The olfactory lobe of its brain, responsible for processing smells, is particularly large compared to that of other animals.  ",1
5897,This heightened ability to detect odors allows it to search for carrion below the forest canopy. ,0
5898,"King vultures, black vultures, and condors, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the turkey vulture to carcasses. ",0
5899,"The turkey vulture arrives first at the carcass, or with greater yellow-headed vultures or lesser yellow-headed vultures, which also share the ability to smell carrion.  ",1
5900,"It displaces the yellow-headed vultures from carcasses due to its larger size,  but is displaced in turn by the king vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal. ",1
5901,"This allows the smaller, weaker-billed turkey vulture access to food, because it cannot tear the tough hides of larger animals on its own. ",0
5902,"The turkey vulture is sometimes accused of carrying anthrax or hog cholera, both livestock diseases, on its feet or bill by cattle ranchers and is therefore occasionally perceived as a threat.  ",1
5903,"However, the virus that causes hog cholera is destroyed when it passes through the turkey vulture's digestive tract.  ",1
5904,This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar black vulture's tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle. ,0
5905,The turkey vulture does not kill live animals but will mix with flocks of black vultures and will scavenge what they leave behind. ,0
5906,"Nonetheless, its appearance at a location where a calf has been killed gives the incorrect impression that the turkey vulture represents a danger to calves.  ",1
5907,The droppings produced by turkey vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.  ,1
5908,"The turkey vulture can be held in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act prevents this in the case of uninjured animals or animals capable of returning to the wild.  ",1
5909,"In captivity, it can be fed fresh meat, and younger birds will gorge themselves if given the opportunity.  ",1
5910,"The turkey vulture species receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States,  by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada,  and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico.  ",1
5911,"In the US it is illegal to take, kill, or possess turkey vultures, their eggs, and any body parts including but not limited to their feathers; violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 for individuals or $200,000 for organizations, and/or a prison term of 1 year.  ",1
5912,It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. ,0
5913,"Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30 percent in 10 years or three generations.[1 Psittacus edwardsii Bechstein, 1811Lathamus azureus Lesson, 1830Neophema pulchella dombraini Mathews, 1915 ",0

5923,"The holotype likely ended up in the Leverian collection in England, and was lost when the collection was broken up and sold. ",0
5924,"German naturalist Johann MatthaÌus Bechstein gave it the scientific name Psittacus edwardsii in 1811, based on FrancÌ§ois Levaillant's description of the species as la Perruche Edwards in his 1805 work Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets.  ",1
5925,Levaillant named it in honour of the English naturalist George Edwards.  ,1

5927,"PrimeveÌre Lesson described it as Lathamus azureus in 1830,   the species name being the Medieval Latin word azureus meaning ""blue"".  Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori defined the new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the turquoise parrot within it and giving it its current scientific name.  ",1
5928,"There is little geographical variation, with some minor local differences in the amount of orange on the belly.  ",1
5929,"In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens,   and hence no subspecies are recognised. ",1

5949,The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.  ,1
5950,The turquoise parrot is found in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas.  ,1
5951,"The northern limit of its range is 26Â° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. ",0
5952,"Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. ",0
5953,"In New South Wales, it is found in a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. ",0
5954,There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. ,0
5955,In Victoria it is found in the vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota.  ,1
5956,"Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot,  the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.  ",1
5957,"The turquoise parrot inhabits open woodland and savanna woodland composed either of native cypress (Callitris species) or eucalypts, particularly white box (Eucalyptus albens), yellow box (E. melliodora), Blakely's red gum (E. blakelyi), red box (E. polyanthemos), red stringybark (E. macrorhyncha), bimble box (E. populnea), or mugga ironbark (E. sideroxylon), and less commonly Angophora near Sydney, silvertop ash forest (E. sieberi) in Nadgee Nature Reserve, and stands of river red gum  (E. camaldulensis), mountain swamp gum (E. camphora) or western grey box (E. microcarpa) in flatter more open areas.

5958,"Within this habitat, it prefers rocky ridges or gullies, or transitional areas between different habitats, such as between woodland and grassland or fields in cultivated areas.  ",1
5959,"The turquoise parrot is considered sedentary and does not migrate, though its movements are not well known. ",0
5960,"Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. ",0
5961,Around 90% of the turquoise parrot population resides in New South Wales. ,0
5962,"The species is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, though a status of near threatened was proposed by Stephen Garnett and Gabriel Crowley in their 2000 work The Action Plan for Australian Birds on account of the significant reduction in distribution.

5963,"Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne up to the 1880s, it vanished from much of its range to the extent that it was presumed extinct in 1915. ",0
5964,"It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949. ",0
5965,"However, numbers in New South Wales began increasing in the 1930s and the species had repopulated East Gippsland by the 1960s.  ",1
5966,"Tentatively estimated at 20,000 breeding birds in 2000, the population is thought to be still rising.  ",1
5967,"The turquoise parrot was once common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. ",0
5968,"It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains were recorded in the mid-twentieth century.  ",1
5969,The turquoise parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. ,0
5970,"Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development.  ",1
5971,"Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented.  ",1
5972,A key issue is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting.  ,1
5973,"The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act).  Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species.  Feral cats and foxes are a threat, particularly to nesting birds and young.  ",1
5974,"Although formerly common in its range, the species was on the brink of extinction in Victoria by 1917. ",0
5975,"However, numbers have built up again since the 1930â40s as it reestablished in its former territory.  ",1
5976,"On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.  ",1
5977,"Turquoise parrots are encountered in pairs or small groups consisting of parents and several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. ",0
5978,"As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks.  ",1
5979,"At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles,  anywhere from 1 to 8 m (3â25 ft) above the ground.  ",1
5980,They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day.  ,1
5981,"The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call has been described as a high-pitched zitting call. ",0
5982,Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.  ,1
5983,The male perches upright on a tree stump and extends its wings to show off its red and blue markings when courting a female.  ,1
5984,"Once paired, both sexes look for a nesting site, which is ultimately chosen by the female.  Breeding has been reported from Girraween National Park on the New South WalesâQueensland border in the north to Wangaratta and Mallacoota in Victoria.  ",1
5985,"Birds use vertical or nearly vertical hollows of live and dead trees, generally eucalypts, as nesting sites. ",0
5986,"The turquoise parrot competes withâand may be ousted byâthe eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius), red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus) and brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) for suitable breeding sites. ",0
5987,"The tree containing the hollow is often located in open woodland, and the hollow itself is generally at least 1 m (3 ft) above the ground. ",0
5988,"Fieldwork in northern Victoria yielded average dimensions of 10 by 6 cm (4 by 3 in) for the hollow entrance, and a depth of around 50 cm (20 in) for the depth of the hole. ",0
5989,] Breeding takes place over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. ,0
5990,"The clutch is laid on a bed of wood dust or leaves and consists of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22 mm long by 18 mm (0.8 by 0.7 in) wide. ",0
5991,"Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. ",0
5992,Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days.  Incubation takes 18 to 21 days.  ,1
5993,"The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping.  ",1
5994,"She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  ",1
5995,"Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit.  ",1
5996,"The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. ",0
5997,"By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. ",0
5998,"They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23 days of age in the wild and up to 30 days of age in captivity.  ",1
5999,"Around 56% of eggs lead to successful fledging of young, with fieldwork in northeastern Victoria yielding an average of 2.77 young leaving the nest. ",0
6000,The lace monitor (Varanus varius) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are nest predators. ,0
6001,"Baby birds may perish by overheating in very hot weather, or by being drowned in the hollows after heavy rain.  ",1
6002,"The turquoise parrot is a predominantly ground-based seed eater,  foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open areas such as pastures. ",1
6003,It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns.  ,1
6004,Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. ,0
6005,"Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5â30 in winter and 6â8 in spring and summer. ",0
6006,"Foraging takes place from early in the morning till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon.  Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.  Grass and shrub seeds form the bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten.  ",1
6007,"The turquoise parrot has been recorded feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the fruit of common fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), seeds of common raspwort (Gonocarpus tetragynus), Geranium species, black-anther flax-lily (Dianella revoluta) and grass species such as the introduced big quaking grass (Briza maxima) and little quaking grass (B. minor) and members of the genus Danthonia,  members of the pea genus Dillwynia, and small-leaved beard-heath ",1
6008,"Seed of the introduced common chickweed (Stellaria media) and capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) are also consumed.  Nectar of Grevillea alpina,  and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.  ",1
6009,"A female was observed placing leaves of the flaky-barked tea-tree (Leptospermum trinervium) underneath its feathers, leading the observers to wonder whether they were being used to deter or kill insects.  ",1
6010,"In 1966, a paramyxovirus with some antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was isolated from the brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. ",0
6011,"That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot and members of the genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease.  ",1
6012,"Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection.  ",1
6013,It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.  ,1
6014,"Initially popular as a caged bird in the 19th century,  the turquoise parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being the high rate of infertile eggs. ",1
6015,"It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. ",0
6016,There is a possibility of interbreeding with other members of the genus Neophema if caged together.[37 ,0
6017,"] Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots.  ",1
6018,"A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. ",0
6019,"Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).[39The variegated fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren that lives in eastern Australia. ",0
6020,"In a species that exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut shoulders and azure crown and ear coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of two subspecies have mainly blue-grey plumage. ",0
6021,"Like other fairywrens, the variegated fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. ",0
6022,Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. ,0
6023,Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. ,0
6024,These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation east of the Great Dividing Range. ,0
6025,"Populations across central, northern and western Australia were considered subspecies of this species until 2018, when they were reclassified as the purple-backed fairywren. ",0
6026,"The variegated fairywren was originally described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827,  and was at first considered a colour variant of the superb fairywren.  ",1
6027,"It is one of eleven species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea.  ",1
6028,Within the genus it belongs to a group of four very similar species known collectively as chestnut-shouldered fairywrens. ,0
6029,"There are well-defined borders between the variegated fairywren and the other chestnut-shouldered wrens in the group, which are the lovely fairywren, red-winged fairywren, and the blue-breasted fairywren.  ",1
6030,"Gregory Mathews erected the genus Leggeornis for the group, with the variegated fairywren as the type species.  ",1
6031,"However, the genus has been reclassified as a subgenus within Malurus.  Like other fairywrens, the variegated fairywren is unrelated to the true wrens. ",1
6032,"Initially, fairywrens were thought to be a member of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae, or the warbler family, Sylviidae, before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975.  ",1
6033,"More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to the honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) and the pardalotes (Pardalotidae) in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea.   ""Variegated fairywren"" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ",1
6034,"The variegated fairywren was formerly known as the variegated wren, until 1978 when the RAOU pushed for the current name to be used. ",0
6035,"In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group due to the variety of forms in north and their absence in the southeast of the continent. ",0
6036,Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm wetter period around 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. ,0
6037,Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. ,0
6038,"Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren and yet another isolated in the northeast became the lovely fairywren. ",0
6039,"Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards, this group occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula became the blue-breasted fairywren. ",0
6040,Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. ,0
6041,"Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,000â13,000 years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards, resulting in the purple-backed fairywren. ",0
6042,This has resulted in the variegated fairywren's range to overlap with all three other species. ,0
6043,"Schodde also proposed that the blue-grey coloured females of the lavender-flanked subspecies were ancestral, while the browner coloration of females of southern forms was an adaptation to dry climates. ",0
6044,A 2017 molecular analysis by Alison J. McLean and colleagues of the former subspecies of the variegated fairywren largely supported Schodde's hypothesis. ,0
6045,"The Great Dividing Range was a major barrier and there is a deep genetic split between the variegated fairywren to its east, and the purple-backed fairywren to the west.  ",1
6046,"In 2018, this split was recognized by the International Ornithological Committee with the subspecies to the north and west reallocated to the purple-backed fairywren.  ",1
6047,"The variegated fairywren is 14â15 cm (5.5â6 in) long  and weighs 6â11 g (0.21â0.39 oz).  Like other fairywrens, it is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting with black and grey-brown. ",1
6048,The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays.  ,1
6049,"The male in breeding plumage has striking bright blue ear coverts, with the crown often slightly darker, a black throat and nape, a royal blue upper back, chestnut shoulders and a bluish-grey tail. ",0
6050,"Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; all males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a red-brown bill and bright rufous lores. ",0
6051,"Immature males will develop black bills by six months of age,  and moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though this may be incomplete with residual brownish plumage and may take another year or two to perfect.  ",1
6052,"Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. ",0
6053,They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring.  ,1
6054,"The blue coloured plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, of the breeding males is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules.  ",1
6055,"The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into that part of the spectrum.[22 ",0
6056,] Vocal communication among variegated fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory.  ,1
6057,The basic song type is a high-pitched reel of a large number of short elements (10â20 per second); this lasts 1â4 seconds. ,0
6058,"The reel of the variegated fairywren is the softest of all malurids.  Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.  ",1
6059,The variegated fairywren is found in scrubland with plenty of vegetation providing dense cover.  ,1
6060,They have been reported to shelter in mammal burrows to avoid extreme heat.  ,1
6061,"In urban situations such as suburban Sydney, these fairywrens have been said to prefer areas with more cover than the related superb fairywren,  though a 2007 survey in Sydney's northern suburbs has proposed that variegated fairywrens may prefer areas of higher plant diversity rather than denser cover as such.  ",1
6062,Forestry plantations of pine and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.  ,1
6063,"Like all fairywrens, the variegated fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. ",0
6064,"Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces,  its balance assisted by a relatively large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. ",1
6065,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. ",1
6066,"Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. ",0
6067,The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. ,0
6068,Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.  ,1
6069,"Like other fairywrens, male variegated fairywrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part of a courtship ritual. ",0
6070,"In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow.  ",1
6071,Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory.  ,1
6072,"The variegated fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with pairs or small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. ",0
6073,"Though less studied than the superb- and splendid fairywrens, it is presumably socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, with each partner mating with other individuals.  ",1
6074,"Females and males feed young equally, while helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young.[35 ",0
6075,"] Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engage in mutual preening.  Occasionally larger groups of around 10 birds have been recorded, though it is unclear whether this was incidental or a defined flock.  Breeding occurs from spring through to late summer; the nest is generally situated in thick vegetation and less than 1 m (3.3 ft) above the ground. ",1
6076,"It is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side. ",0
6077,Two or more broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. ,0
6078,"A clutch consists of three or four matte white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 mm Ã 16 mm (0.47 in Ã 0.63 in).  ",1
6079,"The female incubates the eggs for 14 to 16 days, after which newly hatched nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10â12 days, by which time they are fledged. ",0
6080,Parents and helper birds will feed them for around one month. ,0
6081,"Young birds often remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group, though some move on and breed in the first year.  ",1
6082,"Variegated fairywrens commonly play host to the brood parasite Horsfield's bronze cuckoo and, less commonly, the brush cuckoo and fan-tailed ",0
6083,"The variegated fairywren consumes a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects, including ants, grasshoppers, bugs, flies, weevils and various larvae.  ",1
6084,"Unlike the more ground-foraging superb fairywrens, they mostly forage deep inside shrubby vegetation, which is less than 2 m (7 ft) above the ground.  ",1
6085,"Major nest predators include Australian magpies, butcherbirds, laughing kookaburra, currawongs, crows and ravens, and shrike-thrushes, as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox, feral cats and black rat.  ",1
6086,The variegated fairywren readily adopts a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. ,0
6087,"The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
6088,The variegated fairywren appeared on a 45c postage stamp in the Australia Post Nature of Australia â Desert issue released in June 2002.[40 ,0
6089,The vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus obscurus) is a small passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family found throughout South America and southern North America. ,0
6090,It is a striking exception among the generally drab Tyrannidae due to its vermilion-red coloration. ,0
6091,"The males have bright red crowns, chests, and underparts, with brownish wings and tails. ",0
6092,Females lack the vivid red coloration and can be hard to identifyâthey may be confused for the Say's phoebe. ,0
6093,"The vermilion flycatcher's song is a pit pit pit pidddrrrreeedrr, which is variable and important in establishing a territory. ",0
6094,"Despite being socially monogamous, vermilion flycatchers will engage in extra-pair copulation. ",0
6095,"They also practice within-species brood parasitism, whereby females lay their eggs in the nest of another individual. ",0
6096,Females build shallow open cup nests and incubate the brown-speckled whitish eggs. ,0
6097,Two broods of two or three eggs are laid in a season lasting from March through June. ,0
6098,"Once hatched, both males and females feed the chicks, which are ready to fledge after 15 days. ",0
6099,The species was first described in the late 1830s as a result of the voyages of Charles Darwin. ,0
6100,"The taxonomy of the genus Pyrocephalus was revised in 2016, which led to the identification of several new species from the vermilion flycatcher's subspecies, including the now-extinct San CristoÌbal flycatcher. ",0
6101,"Populations have declined because of habitat loss, though the species remains abundant. ",0
6102,"The overall population numbers in the millions, thus the International Union for the Conservation of Nature considers it a species of least concern. ",0
6103,"The tyrant flycatcher family, Tyrannidae, is a group of passerine birds present only in the Americas; its members are generally drab in coloration.  ",1
6104,"Within it, the subfamily Fluvicolinae comprises the genera Pyrocephalus, Contopus, Empidonax, and Sayornis. ",0
6105,They likely share a common ancestor that belonged in the genus Contopus or Xenotriccus and later diversified. ,0
6106,"The Pyrocephalus are most closely related to Sayornis in terms of morphology, but genetic analysis shows they may be more closely related to Fluvicola.  ",1
6107,"The first description of the vermilion flycatcher was in 1839 by John Gould, who created the current genus Pyrocephalus, and designated his find as Pyrocephalus obscurus. ",0
6108,"The identification was based on specimens brought back by Charles Darwin on the second voyage of HMS Beagle, which lasted from 1831 to 1836.   ",1
6109,"The species was then designated as Pyrocephalus rubinus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840, based on Darwin's specimen taken from James Island.   ",1
6110,"A 2016 molecular study changed the taxonomy of the species, splitting off several new species and re-designated the original bird as Pyrocephalus obscurus.  ",1
6111,"Before the study it was considered a monotypic genus, but now taxonomists (including the International Ornithologists' Union) have elevated three of the vermilion flycatcher subspecies to the rank of species: the Darwin's, San CristoÌbal, and scarlet flycatchers.  ",1
6112,"The genus name Pyrocephalus is Greek and roughly translates to ""fire heada.  or ",1
6113,"The specific epithet obscurus is Latin and means ""dark"" or ""dusky"". :278 The common name comes from its vibrant coloration and its membership in the flycatcher family, which is reflected in its insect-rich diet.  ",1
6114,"Before 2016, authors had recognized between 11 and 13 subspecies (sometimes called races). ",0
6115,"A 2016 molecular study revised that to nine subspecies, made two others their own species (P. nanusâDarwin's flycatcher, P. dubiusâSan CristoÌbal flycatcher, P. rubinusâscarlet flycatcher), and determined that another was not valid (P. major). ",0
6116,"Some works still refer to the vermilion flycatcher as Pyrocephalus rubinus, which can lead to confusion with the scarlet flycatcher (also called Pyrocephalus rubinus).    ",1
6117,"The vermilion flycatcher likely evolved around 1.15 million years ago (mya), the species on the GalaÌpagos Islands having split off around 0.82 mya. ",0
6118,"The South American subspecies had coalesced by about 0.56 mya, and the North American subspecies had diverged from the South American by 0.25 mya.  ",1
6119,"There are nine widely recognized subspecies, which differ primarily in the color and saturation of the male's plumage and the color and amount of streaking of the female's. ",0
6120,"The vermilion flycatcher is a small bird, measuring 13â14 cm (5.1â5.5 in) from tip to tail, around 7.8 cm (3.1 in) from wingtip to body, with a mass between 11 and 14 g (0.39 and 0.49 oz).  ",1
6121,Wingspan ranges from 24 to 25 cm (9.4 to 9.8 in) . ,1
6122,Females are drab and have a peach-colored belly with a dark gray upperside. ,0
6123,"The reddish color varies, but can be vermilion, scarlet, or orangish. ",0
6124,"The lores (region in front of the eyes), nape, ear coverts, wings, upperparts and tail are all brown to blackish brown. ",0
6125,"The female has a grayish crown, as well as grayish ear coverts, wings and tail. ",0
6126,"The flight feathers and wing coverts are slightly paler gray, which create a barring effect. ",0
6127,"Juveniles of both sexes look similar to adult females; juvenile males have much brighter red underparts, whereas juvenile females have yellowish underparts. ",0
6128,"Plumage appears constant throughout the year for both adult sexes and for juveniles.  They have a slight crest, which can be raised when needed.  ",1
6129,"Males are not easily mistaken for other species, but the drab females may be confused with the Say's phoebe.  Worn feathers are replaced by molting, which takes between 62 and 79 days and begins in July, lasting until September. ",1
6130,Many vermilion flycatchers molt only after completing their migration to warmer regions. ,0
6131,"The molt is fairly slow compared to that of other families, as quick molting creates poor feathers and interrupts flight, which is untenable for an aerially feeding species. ",0
6132,"A 2013 study determined that monsoon rain patterns do not affect molting, as had been previously expected. ",0
6133,"Instead, latitude-based temporal effects are more important in timing the molt.  ",1
6134,"Ornithologist David Sibley describes the perching song as a pit pit pit pidddrrrreedrr,  whereas the Cornell Lab of Ornithology describes it as a ching-tink-a-le-tink, with an emphasis on the last syllable.  ",1
6135,"The flight song is given by males who fly high above the canopy, and is described as a pt-pt-pre-ee-een by the Cornell Lab. ",0
6136,The regular song may also be given as a slower chatter call. ,0
6137,Other noises include a pees noise that is given as a call. ,0
6138,"A peent is giving while foraging, but a more aggressive variety is also used between males. ",0
6139,"As a lead-up to copulation, the female may give a tjee-tjee-tjee call. [16The call of the vermilion flycatcher is important in establishing its territory. ",1
6140,"Males make only a single song while perching, but can alter the song to convey different intentions. ",0
6141,"The male's song consists of a variable first part, and a second part with four elements. ",0
6142,"The first part of the song gets longer after nest construction, and before dawn. ",0
6143,The first part encodes information regarding the quality of the male to potential mates and the level of threat to other malesâwhich is related to the intensity with which males defend their territory.  ,1
6144,Urban noise pollution appears to affect songs; a population in Mexico City was found to sing louder and longer songs as ambient noise increased.  ,1
6145,"Singing is not heard year-round; populations in Arizona and Texas sing only from late February through July.  Non-vocal sounds include snapping the beak, by males between songs and by females while watching male courtship flights. ",1
6146,"Their wings may also be used to create a whirring noise while perch hopping or during territorial displays, though this is practiced infrequently.  ",1
6147,"Their range includes almost all of Mexico, extending north into the southwestern United States, and south to scattered portions of Central America, and parts of northwestern and central South America. ",0
6148,"North American populations are generally resident, migrating only at the edge of the range. ",0
6149,"South American populations, especially those further south, may make long migrations to the northernmost parts of the Brazilian Amazon. ",0
6150,This reflects a tendency to overwinter in areas where the temperature does not go below ,0
6151,North American populations generally migrate by late August and return between February and April.  ,1
6152,"Their ability to migrate likely aided their wide colonization of the Americas.  Vermilion flycatchers prefer somewhat open areas and are found in trees or shrubs in savanna, scrub, agricultural areas, riparian woodlands, and desert as well, but usually near water.  ",1
6153,"A study in Arizona found that their preferred breeding range included cottonwood or mesquite tree canopies, although Fremont cottonwoods were not favored. ",0
6154,"Understory plants mainly consisted of invasive Cynodon dactylon grass.  Vermilion flycatchers are generally solitary, though they may form small flocks of not more than five individuals during winter. ",1
6155,"They spend most of their time in trees perching, landing on the ground only rarely to catch insects. ",0
6156,"They do not generally hop, preferring to fly to get around, and glide only infrequently.  Vermilion flycatchers are socially monogamous, but engage in extra-pair copulation. ",1
6157,Both males and females will breed with individuals other than their monogamous mate. ,0
6158,A 2002 study found that 11% of offspring were from extra-paternal copulation. ,0
6159,"They also practice intra-specific brood parasitism, where females lay their eggs in the nest of another vermilion flycatcher. ",0
6160,Between 9.5 and 19% of offspring were the result of brood-parasitism. ,0
6161,"Females often spend long times away from the nest, which enables others to lay eggs in their nests while absent. ",0
6162,"This may simply be a form of parasitism, wherein the pair whose nest is being parasitized gains no benefit. ",0
6163,"For a male mating with many females, and those females laying many of their eggs outside of their nest, this increases the odds that a promiscuous male's offspring are laid in his nest. ",0
6164,This allows the male to outsource the energy-intensive process of egg-laying away from his mate and allows a female to outsource the process of raising her chick. ,0
6165,This is supported by examples of males letting females parasitize their nests in exchange for copulation.  ,1
6166,The flycatcher is a frequent victim of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds.   ,1
6167,"While defending, males raise their crest and fan their tail out. ",0
6168,Males will chase other males out of their territory by flying after them. ,0
6169,"Once nestlings are present, they will also chase off other bird species. ",0
6170,"Courtship involves the male fluffing his crest and chest feathers, fanning the tail, and engaging in a fluttery flight while singing to a female.   ",1
6171,"The vermilion flycatcher's nest is a shallow cup made of small twigs and soft materials, lined with feathers; the nest's rim is often covered with lichen. ",0
6172,Females use a rocking motion of their body to shape the nest during construction. ,0
6173,"Even after construction, the female will continue to add insulating material, such as plant materials, hair, fur, or man-made materials like string. ",0
6174,"Average nest sizes are about 64â76 mm (2.5â3.0 in) across, 25â51 mm (0.98â2.01 in) tall, and with a cup depth of less than 25 mm (0.98 in).  ",1
6175,Nests are typically located within 6 ft (1.8 m) of the ground; the nest is placed in the horizontal fork of a tree branch. ,0
6176,"About 12% of nests are reused, and old nests may be raided for materials for new nests.  Egg-laying begins in March and runs through June; eggs are laid once a day in the early morning. ",1
6177,Eggs are ovate and approximately 17 mm (0.67 in) Ã 13 mm (0.51 in). ,0
6178,"They average 1.6 g (0.06 oz) in weight, which is about 11% of the female's body mass. ",0
6179,"They are a dull whitish color and have large brown splotches in a wreath pattern on the larger end, though egg coloration varies. ",0
6180,"Spotting may be more intense, and the base color may be creamy or even be tan or brown. ",0
6181,Clutches usually contain two or three eggs but may occasionally include up to four.  Eggs are incubated solely by the female for 13â15 days. ,1
6182,"The male feeds the female while she incubates eggs, though females never beg for food. ",0
6183,"The young are altricial, meaning they are incapable of fending for themselves after birth. ",0
6184,"Both parents feed the chicks, although the male may tend to fledglings while the female builds another nest. [23 ",1
6185,"] Nests may be reused during the same season, but this is uncommon; one study found that only 12% of nests were reused, and only if they had been successful in raising a brood. ",0
6186,Re-using nests saves time and energy but perhaps at the cost of a higher parasite load.  Nestlings open their eyes four days after hatching. ,1
6187,The young are ready to leave the nest 15 days after hatching. ,0
6188,"All young generally fledge on the same day, although some may leave a day earlier. ",0
6189,"If the nest is disturbed, nestlings older than 11 days will abandon the nest prematurely. ",0
6190,"There are usually two broods per year, although three are possible.   ",1
6191,"Male at nest Nestlings, who have yet to hit their first juvenile molt Juvenile male P. o. obscurus in Lima, Peru, showing off the lighter juvenile plumage ",0
6192,"The vermilion flycatcher feeds mostly on insects such as flies, grasshoppers and beetlesâthough the exact composition of the diet is poorly studied. ",0
6193,"These are usually taken in mid-air, after a short sally flight from a perch.   ",1
6194,"It is an opportunistic feeder, and has been observed eating small fish, though it is not known to eat plant material.   ",1
6195,"While waiting for insects, they will sit on thin branches and pump their tail up and down.  ",1
6196,"While active, about 90% of their day is spent perching, and only 4â11% is spent chasing prey. ",0
6197,"Once they have spotted prey, they jump up from their perch and give chase. ",0
6198,"If insects are missed on the first attempt, the bird is capable of quite a nimble flight to catch them. ",0
6199,"Once caught, the insects may be beaten before being swallowed whole. ",0
6200,"Otherwise, most prey is caught within 3 m (9.8 ft) of the ground and rarely above water.  ",1
6201,"Unusual reports of predation include by a scrub-jay, and a group of live nestlings eaten by fire ants. ",0
6202,"The oldest recorded individual lived to five and a half years, but otherwise, lifespan data is lacking, as is data about mortality causes. ",0
6203,Yearly nesting success (the percentage of laid eggs which were raised to fledglings) in a Texas study varied from 59 to 80%. ,0
6204,Half of the lost nests contained eggs and half contained young. ,0
6205,A similar study in Ecuador showed success rates from 20 to 59%.  ,1
6206,"A 2008 study found that mites did not greatly affect nesting success, nor did nesting reuse greatly enhance mite populations. ",0
6207,"Fledglings were successfully raised even in infested nests, while nearby, un-infested nests, did not raise any fledglings. ",0
6208,"Though not directly parasitic, flies may lay their eggs in nests, providing a home for their larva.  ",1
6209,"Although the diseases of the vermilion flycatcher are not well studied, the diseases of the birds of the Galapagos are known, and these diseases may have affected the closely related San CristoÌbal flycatcher. ",0
6210,"Introduced and destructive diseases include avian malaria, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, and many others.  ",1
6211,Avian pox viruses and crop canker (caused by Trichomanes gallinae) may have directly contributed to the extinction of the Galapagos sister species.  ,1
6212,"The vermilion flycatcher is a favorite with birders, but it is not generally kept in aviculture as the males tend to lose their vermilion coloration when in captivity.  ",1
6213,"This is likely a diet-based effect, as maintaining bright red coloration in birds requires substantial quantities of yellow precursor zeaxanthin molecules which are then metabolized into red pigment. ",0
6214,"This acts as an indicator of genetic fitness to potential mates, as a bright male is using his diet-based coloration to show off his ability to survive and catch food.   ",1
6215,"The Audubon Society of Tucson, Arizona, publishes an eponymous journal named for the vermilion flycatcher.  ",1
6216,"Because of its enormous range and sizable populationâwith a population estimated ranging between 5,000,000 and 50,000,000 individualsâthe vermilion flycatcher is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.  ",1
6217,"Its overall numbers are declining; between 1966 and 2007, populations declined an average of 1.7% per year. ",0
6218,"Once prolific in southern California, it has become increasingly rare, although it is expanding into new areas such as Florida and Oklahoma. ",0
6219,"Arizona populations are increasing, at a rate of 2.2% per year. ",0
6220,Vermilion flycatchers have adapted to human structures by increasingly nesting in parks and golf courses. ,0
6221,"However, the increased productivity of these areas may be outweighed by an increased presence of brown-headed cowbirdsâwhose parasitic young leave less food for flycatcher youngâas well as increased nest predation. ",0
6222,"Habitat destruction is a major concern for the flycatcher, especially in riparian areas. ",0
6223,"A prime example is along the Lower Colorado River Valley, where changes in water management combined with the destruction of cottonwood-willow riparian habitat have led to the loss of almost all breeding and foraging areas.  ",1
6224,"The San CristoÌbal flycatcher, which was once considered part of the species, was endemic to the GalaÌpagos Islands but went extinct sometime between 1987 and 2012.   ",1
6225,"The Darwin's flycatcher, which was also once part of the species, is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[35 ",0
6226,"The water rail (Rallus aquaticus) is a bird of the rail family which breeds in well-vegetated wetlands across Europe, Asia and North Africa. ",0
6227,"Northern and eastern populations are migratory, but this species is a permanent resident in the warmer parts of its breeding range. ",0
6228,"The adult is 23â28 cm (9â11 in) long, and, like other rails, has a body that is flattened laterally, allowing it easier passage through the reed beds it inhabits. ",0
6229,"It has mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey underparts, black barring on the flanks, long toes, a short tail and a long reddish bill. ",0
6230,"Immature birds are generally similar in appearance to the adults, but the blue-grey in the plumage is replaced by buff. ",0
6231,"The former subspecies R. indicus, has distinctive markings and a call that is very different from the pig-like squeal of the western races, and is now usually split as a separate species, the brown-cheeked rail. ",0
6232,"The water rail breeds in reed beds and other marshy sites with tall, dense vegetation, building its nest a little above the water level from whatever plants are available nearby. ",0
6233,"The off-white, blotched eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and the precocial downy chicks hatch in 19â22 days. ",0
6234,"The female will defend her eggs and brood against intruders, or move them to another location if they are discovered. ",0
6235,"This species can breed after its first year, and it normally raises two clutches in each season. ",0
6236,"Water rails are omnivorous, feeding mainly on invertebrates during summer and berries or plant stems towards winter. ",0
6237,"They are territorial even after breeding, and will aggressively defend feeding areas in winter. ",0
6238,"These rails are vulnerable to flooding or freezing conditions, loss of habitat and predation by mammals and large birds. ",0
6239,"The introduced American mink has exterminated some island populations, but overall the species' huge range and large numbers mean that it is not considered to be threatened. ",0
6240,"Although the origins of the group are lost in antiquity, the largest number of species and the most primitive forms are found in the Old World, suggesting that this family originated there. ",0
6241,"However, the genus Rallus, the group of long-billed reed bed specialists to which the water rail belongs, arose in the New World. ",0
6242,"Its Old World members, the water, African and Madagascan rails, form a superspecies, and are thought to have evolved from a single invasion from across the Atlantic.  Genetic evidence suggests that the water rail is the most closely related of its genus to the Pacific Gallirallus rails,  and is basal to that group.  ",1
6243,"The water rail was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae under its current scientific name, Rallus aquaticus.  ",1
6244,"The binomial name is the Latin equivalent of the English ""water raila.  that had been used by English ornithologists Francis Willughby in 1676  and by Eleazar Albin in 1731.  ",1
6245,"The former subspecies R. a. indicus has very different vocalisations from the water rail, and it was considered to be a separate species in early works.  ",1
6246,"It was restored as a full species R. indicus, by Pamela Rasmussen in her Birds of South Asia ",0
6247,"Her treatment has gained acceptance, and is followed in Birds of Malaysia and Singapore (2010).  ",1
6248,"A 2010 study of molecular phylogeny further supported the possibility of specific status for R. indicus, which is estimated to have diverged from the Western forms around 534,000 years ago.  ",1
6249,The oldest known fossils of an ancestral water rail are bones from Carpathia dated to the Pliocene (1.8-5.3 million years ago). ,0
6250,"By the late Pleistocene, two million years ago, the fossil evidence suggests that the water rail was present across most of its present range.  ",1
6251,"This species is  well-recorded, with over 30 records from Bulgaria alone, and many others from across southern Europe.   and China.  ",1
6252,"A rail from Eivissa, Rallus eivissensis, was smaller but more robust than the water rail, and probably had poorer flight abilities. ",0
6253,"In the Quaternary, the island lacked terrestrial mammals, and this distinctive form presumably descended from its continental relative. ",0
6254,"It became extinct at about the same time as human arrival on the island,  between 16,700 and 5,300 BC.  ",1
6255,The nominate race of water rail is now a very rare resident on Eivissa.  ,1
6256,"The adult of the nominate subspecies is a medium-sized rail, 23â28 cm (9.1â11.0 in) long with a 38â45 cm (15â18 in) wingspan. ",0
6257,Males typically weigh 114â164 g (4.0â5.8 oz) and females are slightly lighter at 92â107 g (3.2â3.8 oz).  ,1
6258,"The upper parts from the forehead to tail are olive-brown with black streaks, especially on the shoulders. ",0
6259,"The sides of the head and the underparts down to the upper belly are dark slate-blue, except for a blackish area between bill and eye, and brownish sides to the upper breast. ",0
6260,"The flanks are barred black and white, and the undertail is white with some darker streaks. ",0
6261,"The long bill and the iris are red, and the legs are flesh-brown. ",0
6262,"The sexes are similar; although the female averages slightly smaller than the male, with a more slender bill,  determining sex through measurements alone is unreliable.  ",1
6263,The juvenile has a blackish crown and a white chin and throat. ,0
6264,"The underparts are buff or white with darker bars, and the flank markings are brown and buff, rather than black and white. ",0
6265,"The undertail is buff, and the eye, bill and leg colours are duller than the adult. ",0
6266,The downy chick is all black apart from a mainly white bill.  ,1
6267,"After breeding, the rail has an extensive moult, and is flightless for about three weeks.  Individual adults can be identified by the markings on the undertail, which are unique to each bird. ",1
6268,"It has been suggested that the dark barring on the undertail of this species is a compromise between the signalling function of a pure white undertail, as found in open water or gregarious species like the common moorhen, and the need to avoid being too conspicuous.  ",1
6269,The water rail can readily be distinguished from most other reed bed rails by its white undertail and red bill; the latter is a little longer than the rest of the rail's head (55â58% of the total) and slightly down-curved.  ,1
6270,"The somewhat similar slaty-breasted rail of tropical Asia has a stouter bill, a chestnut crown and white-spotted upperparts. ",0
6271,"Juvenile and freshly moulted water rails may show a buff undertail like spotted crake, but that species' plumage is spotted with white, and it has a much shorter, mainly yellowish bill. ",0
6272,"The range of the water rail does not overlap with that of any other Rallus species, but vagrants could be distinguished from their American relatives by the lack of rufous or chestnut on the closed wing. ",0
6273,The larger African rail has unstreaked darker brown upperparts and brighter red legs and feet.  ,1
6274,"The water rail is a vocal species which gives its main call, known as ""sharming"", throughout the year. ",0
6275,This is a series of grunts followed by a high-pitched piglet-like squeal and ending in more grunts. ,0
6276,"Members of a pair may call alternately, the male giving lower and slower notes than his partner. ",0
6277,"The courtship song, given by both sexes, is a tyick-tyick-tyick often ending with a trill from the female; the male may sing for hours. ",0
6278,"The flight call is a sharp whistle, and other vocalizations include a loud repeated creak given by the male when showing the nest site to the female, and a purring given by both parents when at the nest with chicks. ",0
6279,"The rails are most vocal when setting up a territory and early in the breeding season, when calling may continue at night. ",0
6280,"Chicks initially cheep weakly, but soon develop a tyk-tyk-trik begging call.  ",1
6281,"When researchers played recordings of the reed warbler at night to attract that species for trapping, they found water rails and other wetland birds were also grounded, despite a lack of suitable habitat, suggesting that the rails and other nocturnal migrants recognised the warbler's song and associated it with the marshy habitat in which it is usually found.  ",1
6282,"The differences between the three other races appear to be clinal, and it is possible that they should all be merged into R. a. aquaticus.  ",1
6283,"The water rail breeds across temperate Eurasia from Iceland and the British Isles discontinuously to North Africa, Saudi Arabia and western China. ",0
6284,"The Icelandic population of water rail, R. a. hibernans, became extinct around 1965, as a result of loss of habitat through the draining of wetlands, and predation by the introduced American mink.  ",1
6285,"Prior to its extinction, at least some birds were present year-round on the island, relying on warm volcanic springs to survive through the coldest months, but this race was also found in winter in the Faroe Islands and Ireland, and on passage through the Western Isles, suggesting that the Icelandic form was a partial migrant.  ",1
6286,"The nominate subspecies, R. a. aquaticus is resident in the milder south and west of its range, but migrates south from areas that are subject to harsh winters. ",0
6287,"It winters within its breeding range, and also further south in North Africa, the Middle East and the Caspian Sea area. ",0
6288,"The peak migration period is September to October, with most birds returning to the breeding grounds from March to mid-April.  ",1
6289,"A specimen of the nominate population labelled as ""Baluchistan"" and collected by Richard Meinertzhagen is considered of doubtful provenance.  ",1
6290,"R. a. korejewi is another partial migrant, with some of the population wintering from Iraq and eastern Saudi Arabia eastwards through Pakistan and northern India to western China.  ",1
6291,"The breeding habitat of the water rail is permanent wetland with still or slow-moving fresh or brackish water and dense, tall vegetation, which may include common reed, reedmace, irises, bur-reed or sedges.  ",1
6292,"In coastal areas, sea rush is common in saltmarsh breeding sites, with sedges and bur-reed dominant in somewhat less saline environments. ",0
6293,A study in the Netherlands and Spain showed that the rush provided better concealment than the other maritime plants. ,0
6294,"As elsewhere, nests were constructed from the nearest available plants.  Where it occurs, saw-sedge provides good breeding habitat, its tall (1.5 m (4.9 ft)) dense structure providing good cover for the nesting rails.  ",1
6295,"The preferred habitat is Phragmites reedbed with the plants standing in water,  with a depth of 5â30 cm (2.0â11.8 in), muddy areas for feeding and a rich diversity of invertebrate species. ",1
6296,Locations with nearby willows or shrubs are favoured above large areas of uniform habitat. ,0
6297,"In addition to natural fresh or marine marshes, this rail may use gravel or clay excavations and peat workings as long as there is suitable habitat with good cover. ",0
6298,"It may be found in rice paddies or on floating islands,  and it occurs in Kashmir in flooded sugarcane fields.  ",1
6299,"A Finnish study showed that the main factor influencing the distribution of water rails was the extent of vegetation cover, with the highest densities in the most vegetated areas; the presence of other marshes nearby was also significant. ",0
6300,"However, factors such as temperature, rainfall, length of shore line and extent of peat, important for some other marsh birds, were not statistically relevant. ",0
6301,"The areas with the highest densities of the rail also had the greatest numbers of three species considered at risk in Finland, the great reed warbler, Eurasian bittern and marsh harrier.  ",1
6302,"The northern limit of breeding seems to be determined by the transition from nutrient-rich wetland to poorer, more acidic water. ",0
6303,"This leads to the replacement of common reed by a more open vegetation type dominated by marsh cinquefoil, which is unsuitable for the rails.  ",1
6304,"One pair in Scotland nested in the open by the side of a road, and when an English nature reserve installed nest boxes for bearded tits (reed ""wigwams"" with a wooden floor), rails nested both in the boxes and under the wooden floor, in the latter case sometimes with the tits in residence above.  ",1
6305,"Although mainly a lowland species, the water rail breeds at 1,240 m (4,070 ft) in the Alps and 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in Armenia.  ",1
6306,"An Italian study suggested that reed bed birds need a minimum area of wetland for breeding, which for the water rail is about 1 ha (2.5 acres),  although the highest densities are in marshes of 10 ha (25 acres) or more.  ",1
6307,"On migration and in winter, a wider range of wet habitats may be used, including flooded thickets or bracken. ",0
6308,"Freezing condition may force birds into more open locations such as ditches, rubbish dumps and gardens,  or even out onto exposed ice.  ",1
6309,"A Welsh study suggested that individual winter territories overlap, with each bird using a significant proportion of the reed bed. ",0
6310,"After site desertion in freezing weather, birds return to their former range. ",0
6311,A density of 14 birds per hectare (6.6 per acre) was recorded.[38 ,0
6312,"] Birds wintering in Iceland rely on warm geothermal streams, and may access streams through tunnels under the snow. ",0
6313,"When not feeding, they may shelter in holes and crevices in the solidified lava.  ",1
6314,"This species sometimes wanders well outside its normal range and vagrants have been found in the Azores, Madeira, Mauritania, the Arctic,  Greenland, Malaysia and Vietnam.  ",1
6315,"This rail is a skulking species, its streaked plumage making it difficult to see in its wetland habitat. ",0
6316,"Its laterally compressed body allows it to slip though the densest vegetation, and it will ""freeze"" if surprised in the open.  ",1
6317,"It walks with a high-stepping gait, although it adopts a crouch when it runs for cover. ",0
6318,"It swims, when necessary, with the jerky motion typical of rails,  and it flies short distances low over the reeds with its long legs dangling. ",1
6319,"Although their flight looks weak, water rails are capable of long sustained flights during their nocturnal migrations,  and are sometimes killed in collisions with lighthouses or wires.  ",1
6320,"British-ringed birds have been recovered from as far away as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Sweden.  ",1
6321,"Birds will charge each other with neck outstretched when breeding, sometimes both members of a pair attacking together. ",0
6322,"Large strongly-marked males are dominant in winter, when the direct aggression is replaced by sharming while standing upright on tip-toe, head jerking and bill thrusting.  ",1
6323,"The birds pair off after arriving at their nesting areas, or possibly even before spring migration. ",0
6324,In large wetlands with good conditions birds may nest 20â50 m (22â55 yd) apart. ,0
6325,"Territories vary in size, but 300 m2 (360 sq yd) is typical. ",0
6326,The pair give courting and contact calls throughout the breeding season. ,0
6327,"The male selects the nest site which he shows to the female while posturing with raised back feathers, wings arched over his back, tail spread and bill pointed vertically downwards. ",0
6328,"Before mating, he raises his wings and tail, and bows with his bill touching his breast. ",0
6329,"The male feeds the female during courtship, and, when incubating, she may leave the nest to display to the male, walking round him, calling softly, rubbing her bill against his and taking short runs to and from him.  ",1
6330,"The nest is made from whatever wetland vegetation is available and built mostly by the male, usually in a single day. ",0
6331,"It is raised 15 cm (5.9 in) or more above the level of the marsh, and is sometimes constructed on clumps of roots, tree stumps or similar support. ",0
6332,It may be built up higher if the marsh waters start to rise. ,0
6333,The nest is 13â16 cm (5.1â6.3 in) across and about 7 cm (2.8 in) high. ,0
6334,"The typical clutch is 6â11 eggs across most of the range,   but appears to be smaller (5â8) in Kashmir at around 1,500 m (4,900 ft ",1
6335,") altitude.  Laying dates vary with location, from late March in Western Europe and North Africa, to late May in Kashmir and June in Iceland.  ",1
6336,The clutch size may be smaller early or late in the breeding season.  ,1
6337,The breeding season can be extended by replacement and second clutches. ,0
6338,"The eggs are blunt and oval, smooth and slightly glossy; the colour varies from off-white to pink-buff, with reddish-brown blotches mainly at the broader end  that sometimes merging into a single patch.[41 ",1
6339,"] Variation in egg size across the four subspecies is much less than the differences between individual eggs; the average size of the eggs of the nominate subspecies, 36 mm Ã 26 mm (1.4 in Ã 1.0 in), is therefore typical for the species as a whole. ",0
6340,"The eggs weigh about 13 g (0.46 oz),  of which 7% is shell.  ",1
6341,"Both parents incubate the eggs, although the female takes the larger share of this duty.  ",1
6342,"The eggs are incubated for 19â22 days to hatching,  with at least 87% success.  ",1
6343,Food is brought to the nest by the other adult and passed to the sitting parent who feeds the chicks. ,0
6344,"The precocial, downy young leave the nest within two days of hatching but continue to be fed by their parents, although the chicks also find some of their own food after about five days.  ",1
6345,They are independent of their parents after 20â30 days  and can fly when aged 7â9 weeks.  ,1
6346,"If a nest appears to have been discovered, the female may carry the chicks or eggs one by one to another location; the eggs are carried in the bill,  but small chicks may be tucked under the wing.  Sitting birds may stay on the eggs even when approached closely, attack the intruder, or feign injury as a distraction.  ",1
6347,"The water rail can breed after its first year, and it normally raises two broods. ",0
6348,"Average survival after fledging has been estimated as between 17 and 20 months, with an annual survival rate slightly less than 50% per year for the first three years, and somewhat higher thereafter.  ",1
6349,"] Water rails are omnivorous, although they mainly feed on animals. ",0
6350,"These include leeches, worms, gastropods, small crustaceans, spiders, and a wide range of both terrestrial and aquatic insects and their larvae. ",0
6351,"Small vertebrates such as amphibians, fish, birds and mammals may be killed or eaten as carrion. ",0
6352,Vertebrates are impaled with a strike of the bill which breaks the prey's spinal cord. ,0
6353,"Plant food, which is consumed more in autumn and winter, includes the buds, flowers, shoots and seeds of water plants, berries and fruit.  ",1
6354,"In south Asia, paddy (harvested rice kernels) may sometimes be eaten.  ",1
6355,Food obtained on land or from mud is normally washed in water before it is eaten.  ,1
6356,This species will occasionally feed in the open even when not forced to do so by cold weather; Edmund Meade-Waldo described seven rails feeding in an open meadow.  ,1
6357,"Despite its skulking nature, the water rail appears to thrive in captivity when fed on animal food such as raw meat or earthworms;  one individual was taught to jump for worms suspended from a fishing rod.  ",1
6358,"Water rails follow definite routes when feeding, frequently returning to good hunting areas. ",0
6359,"They will jump to take insects from plants, climb to find berries, or dislodge apples from trees so they can be eaten on the ground.  ",1
6360,"They will kill birds by impaling or drowning them, particularly if the bird's ability to escape is restricted. ",0
6361,"They have been recorded as killing a European greenfinch and a king quail in an aviary, and small birds trapped in bird ringers' mist nets. ",0
6362,One bird killed a twite caught with it in a Heligoland trap.  ,1
6363,"They are also nest predators, particularly of small birds that nest in reeds such as the great reed warbler.  ",1
6364,"Water rails may defend a winter feeding territory, although this is smaller than when breeding, with individuals perhaps less than 10 m (11 yd) apart;[21 ",0
6365,Aggressive behaviour outside the breeding season may extend to attacks on other marsh rails such as spotted and ,0
6366,Baillon's crake.  Predators of the water rail include a number of mammals and large birds. ,1
6367,"The American mink was partly responsible for the extinction of the Icelandic population,  and cats and dogs have also been recorded as killing this species.  ",1
6368,"At least locally, otters will also eat rails and other water birds.  ",1
6369,"The Eurasian bittern, another reed bed bird, will consume rails,  as will grey herons.  Water rails are particularly vulnerable to the heron when forced out of the cover of the reeds by very high tides.[35 ",1
6370,"] Wetland-hunting harriers are predictable predators,  but more unusually, the rail has also been recorded as a prey item of the tawny owl,[53 ",1
6371,"] short-eared owl,  Eurasian eagle-owl,  greater spotted eagle,  common kestrel,  and night-hunting peregrine falcons.  ",1
6372,"Parasites include the sucking lice Nirmus cuspidiculus and Pediculus ralli,   the tick Ixodes frontalis,  and ",1
6373,"The water rail can be infected by the avian influenza virus   and the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, carried by Ixodes ticks, which is also a human pathogen causing Lyme disease.  ",1
6374,"Three lice, Fulicoffula rallina, Pseudomenopon scopulacorne and Rallicola cuspidatus discovered on dead water rails in 2005 on the Faroe Islands were all species that had not been found on the archipelago ",0
6375,"The parasitic flatworm Ophthalmophagus nasciola was found in one rail's nasal sinus,  and at least three species of feather mite have been detected on the plumage.  ",1
6376,The louse Philopterus ralli and the nematode Strongyloides avium have been found on the closely related brown-cheeked rail R. a. indicus.   ,1
6377,"The water rail's numbers are declining, but it has a large population of 100,000â1,000,000 adults and a huge breeding range estimated at 15,600,000 km2 (6,000,000 sq mi); it is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  ",1
6378,"In most European countries, the population is either stable or decreasing slightly due to loss of habitat. ",0
6379,"The rail's range and numbers are increasing in Morocco, with breeding as far south as Oued Massa.  ",1
6380,"Little is known about the Asian range, but korejewi is a common breeder in Pakistan and Kashmir.  ",1
6381,"In addition to the extirpation of the Icelandic race, mink have been responsible for marked declines in the populations of water rails and other ground-nesting birds in the Hebrides, where the mainly fish-eating otter was the only native carnivore. ",0
6382,"The mink derived from fur farms on Lewis,  from whence they spread through Harris, North Uist and South Uist.  ",1
6383,"Mink and ferret eradication programmes have enabled the rail to return to islands including Lewis and Harris,  and further projects are ongoing or planned on the Scottish mainland.  ",1
6384,"Locally, habitat may be affected by the drainage of marshes, canalisation of water courses, urban encroachment,  and by pollution.  Water rails have been eaten by humans for thousands of years;  they were eaten by the Romans,   and depicted in wall paintings at Pompeii,  and consumption continued through the Middle Ages to modern times.[81 ",1
6385,The water pipit (Anthus spinoletta) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the mountains of Southern Europe and the Palearctic eastwards to China. ,0
6386,It is a short-distance migrant; many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter. ,0
6387,"The water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. ",0
6388,"The head is grey with a broad white supercilium (""eyebrow""), and the outer tail feathers are white. ",0
6389,"In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. ",0
6390,"There are only minor differences among the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. ",0
6391,"The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note. ",0
6392,"Water pipits construct a cup-like nest on the ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14â15 days to fledging. ",0
6393,"Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material. ",0
6394,"The water pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ",0
6395,"The largest of the three groups is the pipits, genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. ",0
6396,Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit.  ,1
6397,"Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics.   ",1
6398,The water pipit was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Alauda spinoletta (characterised as A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis).  ,1
6399,The current genus Anthus was created for the pipits by German naturalist Johann MatthaÌus Bechstein in 1805.  ,1
6400,"Anthus is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific spinoletta is a local dialect word for a pipit from the Florence area of Italy.  ",1
6401,"There are three recognised subspecies of the water pipit: A possible fourth race from the northwestern Caucasus, Anthus spinoletta caucasicus, cannot be reliably separated from A.s. coutellii. ",0
6402,"The latter form is itself a potential new species, based on genetic data, appearance and a characteristic flight call.  ",1
6403,The water pipit is 15â17 centimetres (5.9â6.7 in) long and weighs 18.7â23 grams (0.66â0.81 oz). ,0
6404,"The adult of the nominate race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. ",0
6405,There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. ,0
6406,"The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. ",0
6407,"In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. ",0
6408,"The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks.   ",1
6409,"The sexes are similar although the female has, on average, a greyer head. ",0
6410,"Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. ",0
6411,A. s. coutellii is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the white of the outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. ,0
6412,"It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. ",0
6413,"The water pipit has a complete moult between July and September, although there is considerable individual variation in timing. ",0
6414,"There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. ",0
6415,"This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. ",0
6416,"Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. ",0
6417,"The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. ",0
6418,"The first pre-breeding moult is similar to that of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.  ",1
6419,"The water pipit is closely related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit,  and is rather similar to both in appearance. ",1
6420,"Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. ",0
6421,"The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also typically much warier.  ",1
6422,"The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. ",0
6423,"There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.  ",1
6424,The Eurasian rock pipit's subspecies Anthus petrosus littoralis in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to the water pipit. ,0
6425,"The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers,  and the songs are also different.   ",1
6426,The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.  ,1
6427,"The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note.  ",1
6428,"In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill.  ",1
6429,"The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp ""dzip"" or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. ",0
6430,"The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest.   ",1
6431,"The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence.  ",1
6432,The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.  ,1
6433,"The breeding range of the water pipit is the mountains of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica.   ",1
6434,"The water pipit is predominantly a mountain species in the breeding season, found in alpine pasture and high meadows with short grass and some bushes or rocks. ",0
6435,It is typically found close to wetter areas and often on slopes. ,0
6436,"It breeds between 615â3,200 metres (2,020â10,500 ft) altitude, mostly 1,400â2,500 metres (4,600â8,200 ft). ",0
6437,"It migrates relatively short distances in autumn to lower ground, typically wintering on coastal wetlands, marshes, rice fields and similar habitats. ",0
6438,"Although most birds move to lowlands, some may remain at up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). ",0
6439,"Nominate A. s. spinoletta winters mainly in western and southern Europe and in northwestern Africa; in western Europe some birds show fidelity to the same wintering site, returning each year.  ",1
6440,Birds in Spain appear to move only lower down the mountains in which they breed.  ,1
6441,A.s. coutellii winters at lower altitudes near its breeding areas and also in the Arabian Peninsula and northeast Africa. ,0
6442,"Water pipits leave their breeding sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies may start moving south before then. ",0
6443,"The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May.  ",1
6444,"The water pipit has been recorded as a vagrant in Belarus, Gibraltar and Latvia, and on islands including the Canaries, Iceland, Malta and Svalbard.   ",1
6445,The water pipit is a much less approachable bird as compared to the Eurasian rock pipit. ,0
6446,"It is warier than its relative and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.  ",1
6447,"The water pipit is mainly monogamous, although both sexes may deviate from this occasionally. ",0
6448,"The male has a display flight in which he climbs to 10â30 metres (33â98 ft), flies in an arc and glides back down, singing throughout. ",0
6449,The female constructs a cup nest from grass and leaves which is lined with finer plant material and animal hairs. ,0
6450,"The nest is hidden in vegetation on the ground, sometimes in a hollow. ",0
6451,The normal clutch is four to six eggs laid from the end of April to early July.  ,1
6452,"Eggs are greyish white with darker grey or brownish speckles mainly at the wider end,  and they measure 21 by 16 millimetres (0.83 in Ã 0.63 in) and weigh 2.7 grams (0.095 oz) of which 5% is shell.  ",1
6453,The eggs are incubated by the female for 14â15 days to hatching. ,0
6454,"Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty after a few days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14â15 days.  ",1
6455,"In a Swiss study of the nominate subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. ",0
6456,"Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. ",0
6457,"In the latter study, early nests were more likely to fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators.  ",1
6458,Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.   ,1
6459,"The water pipit's feeding habitat is damp grassland, rather than the rocky coasts favoured by the Eurasian rock pipit.  ",1
6460,"The water pipit feeds mainly on a wide range of invertebrates, including crickets and grasshoppers, beetles, snails, millipedes and spiders. ",0
6461,"Barkflies, true flies, caterpillars and homopterans can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. ",0
6462,"Birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as the springtails Isotoma saltans (the glacier flea) and I. nivalis, and the scorpion fly Boreus izyemalis.  ",1
6463,"Birds normally forage alone or in pairs; in bad weather, foraging is more frequent and involves longer flights, and may be concentrated around marmot burrow entrances. ",0
6464,"Prey items average 8.3 millimetres (0.33 in) in length and are mainly hunted on foot, although flying insects are occasionally caught in the air.  ",1
6465,"Some plant material is taken, and one study on the border of Czechoslovakia and Poland found that 75% of the diet by volume consisted of algae, specifically Ulothrix zonata, despite large numbers of insects being available.  ",1
6466,"In areas with acidic soils, there is less calcium available, potentially leading to thinner egg shells. ",0
6467,"In such locations, pipits are more likely to select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in limestone terrain.  ",1
6468,"The water pipit is hunted by birds of prey including the Eleonora's falcon,  and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes.  ",1
6469,"As with other members of its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. ",0
6470,"Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts.  A new species of feather mite, Proctophyllodes schwerinensis, was discovered on the water pipit,  which is also a host to the fleas Ceratophyllus borealis and Dasypsyllus gallinulae.  ",1
6471,"Along with other Motacillidae species, the water pipit is a host of the protozoan parasite Haemoproteus anthi.  Estimates of the European breeding population of the water pipit vary widely, but may be as high as two million pairs, which would suggest a global population of tens of millions of individuals spread over 3.7 millionsquare kilometres (1.4 millionsq mi).  ",1
6472,"The range is discontinuous due to the mountain habitat this species uses,  but the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason the water pipit is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.  ",1
6473,"Breeding densities (in pairs per ten ha) have been recorded as 2.4 in the Jura Mountains, 3.0â3.6 in the Alps and 4.5 in the Tatra Mountains of Poland. [bCorvus monedula Linnaeus, 1758 ",1
6474,"The western jackdaw (Coloeus monedula), also known as the Eurasian jackdaw, the European jackdaw, or simply the jackdaw, is a passerine bird in the crow family. ",0
6475,"Found across Europe, western Asia and North Africa; it is mostly resident, although northern and eastern populations migrate south in the winter. ",0
6476,"Four subspecies are recognised, which differ mainly in the colouration of the plumage on the head and nape. ",0
6477,"Linnaeus first described it formally, giving it the name Corvus monedula. ",0
6478,"The common name derives from the word jack, denoting ""small"", and daw, a less common synonym for ""jackdaw"", and the native English name for the bird. ",0
6479,"Measuring 34â39 centimetres (13â15 in) in length, the western jackdaw is a black-plumaged bird with a grey nape and distinctive pale-grey irises. ",0
6480,"It is gregarious and vocal, living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland, open woodland, on coastal cliffs, and in urban settings. ",0
6481,"Like its relatives, jackdaws are intelligent birds, and have been observed using tools. ",0
6482,"An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant material and invertebrates, as well as food waste from urban areas. ",0
6483,"Western jackdaws are monogamous and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. ",0
6484,About five pale blue or blue-green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female. ,0
6485,The western jackdaw was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th century work ,0
6486,"Owing to its supposed fondness for picking up coins, Linnaeus gave it the binomial name Corvus monedula, choosing the specific name moÌneÌduÌla, which is derived from moneta, the Latin stem of the word ""money"".   Jackdaws are sometimes placed in the genus Coloeus, from the Ancient Greek ÎoÎ¿Î»Î¿Î1Î¿ÌÏ (koloios) for jackdaw,  though most subsequent works have retained the two jackdaw species in Corvus.  ",1
6487,"The original Old English word cÌeÌo (pronounced with initial ch) gave modern English ""chough""; Chaucer sometimes used this word to refer to the western jackdaw,  as did Shakespeare in Hamlet although there has been debate about which species he was referring to.  ",1
6488,"This onomatopoeic name, based on the western jackdaw's call, now refers to corvids of the genus Pyrrhocorax; the red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as the ""Cornish chough"" and then just the ""chough"", the name transferring from one species to the other.  ",1
6489,"The common name jackdaw first appeared in the 16th century, and is thought to be a compound of the forename Jack, used in animal names to signify a small form (e.g. jack snipe), and the archaic native English word daw.  ",1
6490,"The metallic chyak call may be the origin of the jack part of the common name,  but this is not supported by the Oxford English Dictionary.  ",1
6491,"Daw, first used for the bird in the 15th century, is held by the Oxford English Dictionary to be derived from the postulated Old English dawe, citing the cognates in Old High German taÌha, Middle High German taÌhe or taÌchele, and modern German Dahle or Dohle, and dialectal Tach, DaÌhi, DaÌche and Dacha. ",0
6492,Scottish and north English dialects have included ka or kae since the 14th century. ,0
6493,"Caddow is potentially a compound of ka and dow, a variant of daw. ",0
6494,"Other dialectal or obsolete names include caddesse, cawdaw, caddy, chauk, college-bird, jackerdaw, jacko, ka-wattie, chimney-sweep bird (from their nesting propensities), and sea-crow (from the frequency with which they are found on coasts). ",0
6495,"An archaic collective noun for a group of jackdaws is a ""clattering"".  ",1
6496,A study in 2000 found that the genetic distance between western jackdaws and the other members of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus.  ,1
6497,"This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829,  in her Birds of South Asia (2005),  a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters.  ",1
6498,A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. ,0
6499,"It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C. dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade.  ",1
6500,The names Coloeus monedula and Coloeus dauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list.  ,1
6501,"The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. ",0
6502,Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.  ,1
6503,C. m. monedula intergrades into C. m. soemmerringii in a transition zone running from Finland south across the Baltic and eastern Poland to Romania and Croatia.  ,1
6504,"Measuring 34â39 centimetres (13â15 in) in length and weighing around 240 grams (8.5 oz), the western jackdaw is the second smallest member of the genus Corvus.   ",1
6505,"Most of the plumage is a shiny black, with a purple (in subspecies monedula and spermologus) or blue (in subspecies cirtensis and soemmerringii) sheen on the crown,  forehead, and secondaries, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, primaries, and tail. ",1
6506,"The cheeks, nape and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. ",0
6507,"The legs are black, as is the short stout bill,  the length of which is about 75% of the length of the rest of the head.  ",1
6508,There are rictal bristles covering around 40% of the maxilla and 25% of the lower mandible.  ,1
6509,"The irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age.  ",1
6510,"The sexes look alike,   though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before moulting.  Western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from June to September in the western parts of their range, and a month later in the east.  ",1
6511,The purplish sheen of the cap is most prominent just after moulting.  Immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage.  ,1
6512,"The head is a sooty black, sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. ",0
6513,"The main differences are the presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. ",0
6514,Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. ,0
6515,"Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. ",0
6516,"However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.  ",1
6517,"A skilled flyer, the western jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide. ",0
6518,"It has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying, though these are not evident when birds are migrating.  ",1
6519,Wind tunnel experiments show that the preferred gliding speed is between 6 and 11 metres (20 and 36 ft) per second and that the wingspan decreases as the bird flies faster.  ,1
6520,"On the ground, western jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly, their short legs giving them a rapid gait. ",0
6521,"Within its range, the western jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features. ",0
6522,"From a distance, it can be confused with a rook (Corvus frugilegus), or when in flight, with a pigeon or chough.  Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. ",1
6523,"They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. ",0
6524,They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs.  ,1
6525,"The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. ",0
6526,"Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. ",0
6527,"The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.  Western jackdaws are voluble birds. ",1
6528,"The main call, frequently given in flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak.  ",1
6529,"A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. ",0
6530,"Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa.  Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. ",1
6531,"Western jackdaws also have a hoarse, drawn-out alarm call,  arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them.  ",1
6532,Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. ,0
6533,"As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. ",0
6534,"From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise.  ",1
6535,"The western jackdaw is found from Northwest Africa through all of Europe, except for the subarctic north, and eastwards through central Asia to the eastern Himalayas and Lake Baikal. ",0
6536,"To the east, it occurs throughout Turkey, the Caucasus, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwestern India.  ",1
6537,"The range is vast, with an estimated global extent between 1 and 10 million square kilometres (0.4â4 million square miles). ",0
6538,"It has a large global population, with an estimated 15.6 to 45 million individuals in Europe alone.[45 ",0
6539,"] Censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in Great Britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between the 1970s and 2010, although this increase may be related to recovery from previous periods when they were regarded as pests.  ",1
6540,"The UK population was estimated at 2.5 million individuals in 1998, up from 780,000 in 1970.  ",1
6541,"Most populations are resident, but the northern and eastern populations are more migratory,  relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May.  ",1
6542,Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer and retracts in winter.  ,1
6543,"They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands, particularly in the winter and spring, and occasionally to Iceland.  ",1
6544,"Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in northwestern Kazakhstan, the northern Caspian, and the Tian Shan region of western China. ",0
6545,"They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan,  and are winter vagrants to Lebanon, where they were first recorded in 1962.  ",1
6546,"In Syria, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place.  ",1
6547,"The subspecies soemmerringii occurs in south-central Siberia and extreme northwestern China and is accidental to Hokkaido, Japan.  ",1
6548,A small number of western jackdaws reached northeastern North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania.  ,1
6549,"They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar, Mauritania, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon,  and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt.  Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, cultivated land, coastal cliffs, and towns. ",1
6550,They thrive when forested areas are cleared and converted to fields and open areas.  ,1
6551,"Habitats with a mix of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius).  ",1
6552,"Along with other corvids such as the rook, common raven (Corvus corax), and hooded crow (C. cornix), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north.  ",1
6553,"The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold. ",0
6554,"The cause of the increase is unknown, but a reduction in the number of rooks may have benefited the species locally, or rooks overwintering in Belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw.  ",1
6555,"Generally wary of people in the forest or countryside, western jackdaws are much tamer in urban areas.  ",1
6556,"Like magpies,  they are known to show interest in shiny objects such as jewellery.  ",1
6557,"John Gay, in his Beggar's Opera, notes that ""A covetous fellow, like a jackdaw, steals what he was never made to enjoy, for the sake of hiding it"".  ",1
6558,"In Tobias Smollett's The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, a scathing character assassination runs, ""He is ungracious as a hog, greedy as a vulture, and thievish as a jackdaw. ",0
6559,"Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are generally seen in flocks of varying sizes, though males and females pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks.  ",1
6560,"Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting,  with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. ",1
6561,"At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night.  Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows  or rooks,  the latter particularly when migrating or roosting.  ",1
6562,"They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England.  ",1
6563,"Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators.  Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group.  ",1
6564,"Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.  ",1
6565,"In his book King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz described and analysed the complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. ",0
6566,He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. ,0
6567,"He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank.  ",1
6568,"Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. ",0
6569,"Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter.[64 ",0
6570,"] Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. ",0
6571,This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. ,0
6572,"According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.  ",1
6573,"Social hierarchy in western jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting, fighting, and threat displaysâseveral of which have been described. ",0
6574,"In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. ",0
6575,"Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. ",0
6576,"In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. ",0
6577,Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. ,0
6578,"In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. ",0
6579,"In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. ",0
6580,This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females.  ,1
6581,"In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. ",0
6582,Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. ,0
6583,Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. ,0
6584,Western jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers. ,0
6585,"Known as allopreening, this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair.  ",1
6586,Genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation  and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure.  ,1
6587,"Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies.  Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.  ",1
6588,"Western jackdaws usually breed in colonies with pairs collaborating to find a nest site, which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of the year.  ",1
6589,"They nest in cavities in trees or cliffs, in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys, the common feature being a sheltered site for the nest. ",0
6590,The availability of suitable sites influences their presence in a locale.  ,1
6591,"They may also use church steeples for nesting, a fact reported in verse by 18th century English poet William Cowper: A great frequenter of the church,Where, bishoplike, he finds a perch, And dormitory too.  ",1
6592,"A mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it; it is then built on top of the platform formed.  This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them.  ",1
6593,"In his The Natural History of Selborne, Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting.  ",1
6594,The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl (Strix aluco) for nest sites in the Netherlands.  ,1
6595,"They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius)  and stock dove (Columba oenas).  Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow, rook or magpie.  ",1
6596,"Nests are lined with hair, wool, dead grass and many other materials.  ",1
6597,"The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids,  being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker speckles ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet.  Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies monedula average 35.0 by 24.7 millimetres (1.38 in Ã 0.97 in) and 11.1 g (0.39 oz) in weight, those of subspecies soemmerringii 34.8 by 25.0 millimetres (1.37 in Ã 0.98 in) in size and 11.3 g ",1
6598,"(0.40 oz) in weight, and those of subspecies spermologus 35.0 by 25.2 millimetres (1.38 in Ã 0.99 in) in size and 11.5 g (0.41 oz) in weight.  ",1
6599,"Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs,  although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs.  ",1
6600,"The eggs are incubated by the female for 17â18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. ",0
6601,"They fledge after 28â35 days,  and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so.  Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and incubation begins before clutch completion, which often leads to the death of the last-hatched young. ",1
6602,"If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive.  Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.  ",1
6603,"The great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) has been recorded as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel.   ",1
6604,"Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland.  ",1
6605,The European pine marten (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests are part of a colony.  ,1
6606,Foraging takes place mostly on the ground in open areas and to some extent in trees.  ,1
6607,"Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about.  ",1
6608,"Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. ",0
6609,Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. ,0
6610,"Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil.  Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight.  ",1
6611,"Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.  ",1
6612,"The western jackdaw tends to feed on small invertebrates up to 18 millimetres (0.71 in) in length that are found above ground, including various species of beetle (particularly cockchafers of the genus Melolontha,  and weevil larvae and pupae. ), Diptera, and Lepidoptera species, as well as snails and spiders. ",1
6613,"Also eaten are small rodents, bats,  the eggs and chicks of birds, and carrion such as roadkill. ",1
6614,"Vegetable items consumed include farm grains (barley, wheat and oats), weed seeds, elderberries, acorns, and various cultivated fruits.  ",1
6615,Examination of the gizzards of western jackdaws shot in Cyprus in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals (predominantly wheat) and insects (notably cicadas and beetles).  ,1
6616,"The diet averages 84% plant material except when breeding, when the main food source is insects.  ",1
6617,"A study in southern Spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of silicaceous and calcareous grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium.  Opportunistic and highly adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet markedly depending on available food sources.  ",1
6618,They have been recorded taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark ,0
6619,"(Alauda arvensis),  Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea),  rock pigeon (Columba livia),  and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto).  ",1
6620,"A field study of a large city dump on the outskirts of LeoÌn in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism.  ",1
6621,"The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.  Western jackdaws practice active food sharing â where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor â with a number of individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. ",1
6622,They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food.  ,1
6623,The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. ,0
6624,"Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. ",0
6625,"The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. ",0
6626,It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.  ,1
6627,Western jackdaws have learned to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after delivery by the milkman. ,0
6628,The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. ,0
6629,This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England  and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. ,1
6630,It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds from pecking open bottles in the future.  ,1
6631,An outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to western jackdaws. ,0
6632,"During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. ",0
6633,"The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV).  Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.  ",1
6634,"The western jackdaw has been hunted as vermin, though not as heavily culled as other species of corvid.  ",1
6635,"After a series of poor harvests in the early 1500s, Henry VIII introduced a Vermin Act in 1532 ""ordeyned to dystroye Choughes (i.e. jackdaws), Crowes and Rokes"" to protect grain crops from their predations. ",0
6636,"Western jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit, especially cherries. ",0
6637,"This act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion, but Elizabeth I passed the Act for the Preservation of Grayne in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour. ",0
6638,The species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until the mid-20th century. ,0
6639,Western jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs.  ,1
6640,"In a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids, Antonia Hereth notes that the German naturalist Alfred Brehm considered the western jackdaw to be a lovable bird, and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture.  ",1
6641,The western jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. ,0
6642,"The other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. ",0
6643,An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them.  ,1
6644,"As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations.[99 ",0
6645,] Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.  ,1
6646,"An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs ""The swans will sing when the jackdaws are silent"", meaning that educated or wise people will speak only after the foolish have become quiet.  In Ancient Greek folklore, a jackdaw can be caught with a dish of oil. ",1
6647,"A narcissistic creature, it falls in while looking at its own reflection.  ",1
6648,"The mythical Princess Arne Sithonis was bribed with gold by King Minos of Crete, and was punished by the gods for her greed by being transformed into an equally avaricious jackdaw, who still seeks shiny things.  ",1
6649,The Roman poet Ovid described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work Amores.  ,1
6650,"Pliny notes how the Thessalians, Illyrians, and Lemnians cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers' eggs. ",0
6651,The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.  ,1
6652,"In some cultures, a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival; alternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen.  ",1
6653,A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain. ,0
6654,"The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury records the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering ""more loudly than usual,"" grew pale and became fearful of suffering a ""dreadful calamity"", and that ""while yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes arrived"".  Czech superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling, war will follow, and that jackdaws will not build nests at SaÌzava after being banished by Saint Procopius.  ",1
6655,The jackdaw was considered sacred in Welsh folklore as it nested in church steeples â it was shunned by the Devil because of its choice of residence.  Nineteenth century belief in the Fens held that seeing a jackdaw on the way to a wedding was a good omen for a bride.  ,1
6656,"The jackdaw is featured on the Ukrainian town of Halych's ancient coat of arms, the town's name allegedly being derived from the East Slavic word for the bird.  ",1
6657,"In The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1979), Milan Kundera notes that Franz Kafka's father Hermann had a sign in front of his shop with a jackdaw painted next to his name, since ""kavka"" means jackdaw in Czech.[110 ",0
6658,"The western yellow robin (Eopsaltria griseogularis) is a species of bird in the Australasian robin family, Petroicidae, native to Australia. ",0
6659,"Described by John Gould in 1838, the western yellow robin and its Australian relatives are not closely related to either the European or American robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. ",0
6660,"Ranging between 13.5 and 15.5 cm (5 1â4 and 6 in) long, it has grey upperparts, and a grey breast and head, broken by whitish streaks near the bill and below the eye, with a conspicuous yellow belly. ",0
6661,"Two subspecies are recognized: subspecies griseogularis, which has a yellow rump, and subspecies rosinae with an olive-green rump. ",0
6662,"The species inhabits open eucalypt jungle, woodland, and scrub, generally favouring habitats with significant understory. ",0
6663,"Its range comprises the Southwest of Western Australia and the state's southern coastline, as well as the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. ",0
6664,"Predominantly insectivorous, the western yellow robin pounces on prey from a low branch or forages on the ground. ",0
6665,"Although it is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species, it has declined in parts of its range. ",0
6666,"English ornithologist John Gould described the western yellow robin as Eopsaltria griseogularis in 1838, referring to a specimen collected at the Swan River Colony.  ",1
6667,The genus Eopsaltria had been introduced by English naturalist William Swainson six years earlier for what is now the eastern yellow robin (E. australis).  ,1
6668,"The specific name is derived from the Medieval Latin words griseus, meaning 'grey', and gula meaning ""throat"".  Gould reported that it was common both at the new colony on the Swan Coastal Plain and at any site with brush-like shrubs.  ",1
6669,It was included in the first collection of local fauna assembled for the newly founded Zoological Society of London in the 1830s.  ,1
6670,"In 1979, Western Australian ornithologist Julian Ford proposed treatment of the western and eastern yellow robin as a single species on account of similarities in calls, ecology, and behavior. ",0
6671,"Playback of one species' calls in the other's territory evoked a response.  Bird taxonomist Richard Schodde did not feel that this finding warranted the lumping of the two species and concluded in 1999 that they formed a superspecies.  Analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of Australasian robins in 2009 and 2011 revealed that the divergence between the eastern and western yellow robin was consistent with species-level separation, confirming their status as distinct species.   ",1
6672,"Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described a second subspeciesâEopsaltria griseogularis rosinaeâin 1912,  named for Ethel Rosina White, wife of South Australian ornithologist, Samuel Albert White.   ",1
6673,Schodde observed that the delineation between subspecies does not correspond with a change in habitat and was hence valid.  ,1
6674,Western yellow robin is the official name given to this species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  ,1
6675,"Like all Australasian robins, it is not closely related to either the European robin (Erithacus rubecula) or the American robin (Turdus migratorius), but rather belongs in the Australasian robin family Petroicidae.  ",1
6676,"The family is most closely related to the families Eupetidae (rail-babbler), Chaetopidae (rockjumper), and Picathartidae (rockfowl)âthese all forming a basal lineage in the Passerida.  ",1
6677,"Gould called it 'grey-breasted robin' in 1848,  and other names used included grey-breasted shrike-robin and grey-breasted yellow robin from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ",1
6678,The 'shrike-' prefix was dropped by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1926.  ,1
6679,"The earliest recorded name is b'am-booreâreported by English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert in 1840, and published in Gould's Birds of Australiaâis derived from the Nyungar language. ",0

6681,"The western yellow robin ranges between 13.5 and 15.5 cm (5 1â4 and 6 in) long, with a wingspan of 24â27.5 cm (9 1â2â10 3â4 in) and weight of 20 g (0.7 oz). ",0
6682,"The male and female are similar in size and coloration, with no seasonal variation in plumage.  ",1
6683,"The head, neck, and upper parts are grey, with a white throat fading into a grey breast. ",0
6684,"The lores are black, the eyebrows are paler grey, and there is some faint pale streaking over the ear coverts. ",0
6685,The rump and upper tail coverts are yellow in the nominate subspecies and olive-green in subspecies rosinae. ,0
6686,There is a broad area of intermediate coloration between the core ranges of the two subspecies. ,0
6687,"Birds of subspecies rosinae have longer wings and tail overall, and a shorter bill and tarsus. ",0
6688,Those from the west coast between Cliff Head and Kalbarri are significantly smaller overall. ,0
6689,Intermediate forms between the two subspecies are found over a broad band between Lancelin and Jurien Bay southeast through the inner Wheatbelt to the coast between Denmark and Fitzgerald River ,0
6690,"Juveniles have dark brownish head, neck, and upper parts coarsely streaked with creamy white. ",0
6691,"The chin and throat are grey-white, the breast is cream and brown, and the belly is white or off-white, tinged with brown.  ",1
6692,"They  molt after a few months into immature plumage, resembling adults but retaining some brownish flight feathers and secondary coverts on their wings and tail.  ",1
6693,"The western yellow robin produces its song with sequences of extended whistles, begun with two briefly piped notes.  ",1
6694,"Its song is often heard before dawn, described as having a mournful quality, and is a familiar sound in southwest forests and woodlands. ",0
6695,"It also utters a scolding call, transcribed as ch-churr or churr-churr, and a two-syllabled zitting call. ",0
6696,"Around nesting time, the female utters a courtship or food-begging call, composed of a long note with a deeper staccato note at the end.23] ",0
6697,The similar eastern yellow robin is found only in the eastern states. ,0
6698,"Immature birds closely resemble immature white-breasted robins (Quoyornis georgianus), though both are usually close by their respective parents.  Young western yellow robins also have an olive tinge to the edges of their flight and tail feathers,  and gain yellow feathers on their bellies as they molt from juvenile plumage.  ",1
6699,"In Western Australia, the western yellow robin is found south and west of an imaginary line between Kalbarri and Norseman, though it is largely absent from the coastal plain between Dongara and Rockingham. ",0
6700,It is a rare vagrant north to Shark Bay and Toolonga Nature Reserve. ,0

6704,"Subspecies Eopsaltria griseogularis rosinae occurs from Jurien Bay and Tamala then inland across the Wheatbelt and Goldfields to the southeastern Western Australian coastline, across the Great Australian Bight and on the Eyre Peninsula.11] ",0
6705,"Within its range, the western yellow robin is found in eucalypt forest and woodland, and mallee and acacia-shrubland in drier (semi-arid) regions. ",0
6706,"Fieldwork in the Dryandra Woodland found that it prefers locations with thicker canopy, a thicker layer of leaf litter, and logs. ",0
6707,"The latter two directly provide habitat for insects upon which the western yellow robin feeds, while the canopy makes for cooler ground temperatures (as well as more leaf litter) that are also favorable to insects. ",0
6708,The presence of wandoo trees (Eucalyptus wandoo) and shrubs of the genus Gastrolobium also indicates thicker leaf litter. ,0
6709,"The species also avoids parts of the woodland bordering on adjacent farmland, as these areas have a thinner layer of leaf litter.  ",1
6710,"In tall jarrah-marri forest, it generally remains in the midstory of bull banksia (Banksia grandis) or understory shrubs.  ",1
6711,The social behaviour of the western yellow robin has been little studied. ,0

6713,"In autumn and winter, western yellow robins may join mixed hunting flocks with other insect-eating birds,  such as Gilbert's honeyeater (Melithreptus chloropsis), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), grey fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa), and thornbills ",1

6715,"The nest is located in the fork or on a branch of a tree, usually a eucalypt, such as marri (Corymbia calophylla), jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), and wandoo in Western Australia, or sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) in South Australia. ",0
6716,"Other trees include snottygobble (Persoonia longifolia), native cypress (Callitris), Jacksonia, Acacia, or she-oak (Casuarinaceae). ",0
6717,"In more arid country, they may choose mallee eucalypts, bluebush (Maireana),  or quandong (Santalum acuminatum).[28 ",1
6718,"] Fieldwork in the Dryandra Woodland found nests were located in the lower part of the tree canopy, so birds were able to have a clear view of the ground, and be concealed by foliage from aerial predators above.  ",1
6719,"The nest is an open cup made of strips of bark, grass, and twigs. ",0
6720,"Spider webs, dried wattle, and gum leaves are used for binding or lining. ",0
6721,"It is 7â9 cm (2 3â4â3 1â2 in) high and 5â7 cm (2â2 3â4 in) wide, with a 3â5 cm (1 1â4â2 in) wide inner cup-shaped depression. ",0
6722,The female builds the nest and is fed by the male and helper birds during this time. ,0
6723,"The clutch generally numbers two or rarely three buffs, pale yellow or pearl-grey eggs that are irregularly marked with red-brown and are 18â22 mm long by 15â16 mm wide.  ",1
6724,The eggs are more elongated than those of the eastern yellow robin.  ,1
6725,"Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; that is, they are born blind and naked. ",0
6726,"They are fed by both parents and helpers, and the female leaves to forage for herself during this period.28] ",0
6727,The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica) have been recorded preying on nestlings.  ,1
6728,"The species is selected as a host for brood parasites, specifically the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and the shining bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus).  ",1
6729,"The maximum age recorded from banding has been eight years, in a bird banded at Kodj Kodjin Reserve, Western Australia, which was caught and released at the same location in June 1994.[31 ",0
6730,"] Arthropods, particularly insects, form the bulk of the western yellow robin's diet, although seeds are sometimes eaten. ",0
6731,It hunts by scanning the ground from branches or trunks of trees and pouncing on its prey mostly on the ground.  ,1
6732,"One study in Dryandra Woodland found that western yellow robins caught 96% of their prey on the ground,  while fieldwork in the same locale showed that they often forage near fallen logs, particularly in the warmer months. ",1
6733,Leaf litter near logs often retains more moisture in warmer months and thus shelters more abundant prey.  ,1
6734,"The foraging behavior was first described as resembling the robins of Europe, making short flights to the ground and returning to a twig or branch and seemingly incapable of sustained flight. ",0
6735,"The appearance of this behavior has been familiar to observers near frontiers of land clearing, although the roosting habits are carefully obscured.   ",1
6736,"The IUCN Red List assessed the western yellow robin in 2016 as a least-concern species, noting a large distribution range and population that, while declining, did not meet their criteria for conservation status of vulnerable to extinction. ",0
6737,"Recognized threat factors to the population trajectory of the western yellow robin are global warming, particularly severe weather events, and anthropogenic alterations that degrade or remove its habitat.  ",1
6738,"The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large bird in the stork family, Ciconiidae. ",0
6739,"Its plumage is mainly white, with black on the bird's wings. ",0
6740,"Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100â115 cm (39â45 in) from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155â215 cm (61â85 in) wingspan. ",0
6741,"The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. ",0
6742,"The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. ",0
6743,"When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water. ",0
6744,"A carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. ",0
6745,"It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. ",0
6746,"It is a monogamous breeder, but does not pair for life. ",0
6747,"Both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. ",0
6748,"Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs, which hatch asynchronously 33â34 days after being laid. ",0
6749,Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young. ,0
6750,"The young leave the nest 58â64 days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7â20 days. ",0
6751,The white stork has been rated as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ,0
6752,"It benefited from human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared, but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. ",0
6753,"Conservation and reintroduction programs across Europe have resulted in the white stork resuming breeding in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. ",0
6754,"It has few natural predators, but may harbour several types of parasite; the plumage is home to chewing lice and feather mites, while the large nests maintain a diverse range of mesostigmatic mites. ",0
6755,"This conspicuous species has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks. ",0
6756,"English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the white stork in the 17th century, having seen a drawing sent to him by his friend and natural history enthusiast Sir Thomas Brown of Norwich. ",0
6757,"They noted they were occasional vagrants to England, blown there by storms.   ",1
6758,"It was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae,  where it was given the binomial name of Ardea ciconia. ",1
6759,It was reclassified to (and was designated the type species of) the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.   ,1
6760,"Both the genus and specific epithet, ciÌcoÌnia, are the Latin word for ""stork"",  originally recorded in the works of Horace and Ovid.  ",1
6761,"The Latin word survives in most Romance languages (cicogna, ciguÌenÌa, cegonha and the like). ",0
6762,"The word stork is derived from the Old English word storc, and appeared in the 10th-century works the Erfurt Glossary, where the word is equated with Ciconia, and Aelfric's Homilies. ",0
6763,"The word is related to the Old High German storah, ""stork"", and similar words in many other European languages, all of which are descended from the Germanic sturko-z.  ",1
6764,"There are two subspecies: The stork family contains six genera in three broad groups: the open-billed and wood storks (Mycteria and Anastomus), the giant storks (Ephippiorhynchus, Jabiru and Leptoptilos), and the ""typical"" storks, Ciconia. ",0
6765,"The typical storks include the white stork and six other extant species,  which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage.  ",1
6766,"Its closest relatives are the larger, black-billed Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana) of East Asia, which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the white stork,  and the maguari stork (C. maguari) of South America. ",1
6767,"Close evolutionary relationships within Ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and, biochemically, through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridization.  ",1
6768,"A Ciconia fossil representing the distal end of a right humerus has been recovered from Miocene beds of Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya.  ",1
6769,"The 24â6 million year old fossil could have originated from either a white stork or a black stork (C. nigra), which are species of about the same size with very similar bone structures. ",0
6770,The Middle Miocene beds of Maboko Island have yielded further remains.  ,1
6771,"It has a length of 100â115 cm (39â45 in),   and a standing height of 100â125 cm (39â49 in). ",1
6772,The wingspan is 155â215 cm (61â85 in) and its weight is 2.3â4.5 kg (5.1â9.9 lb).   ,1
6773,"Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck and a long straight pointed beak.  ",1
6774,"The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average.  ",1
6775,The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts; the black is caused by the pigment melanin.  ,1
6776,The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays.  ,1
6777,"The irises are dull brown or grey, and the peri-orbital skin is black. ",0
6778,"The adult has a bright red beak and red legs,  the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet. ",1
6779,"In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere.  ",1
6780,"As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar.  ",1
6781,It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. ,0
6782,It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched. ,0
6783,"In contrast, it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting.  Moulting has not been extensively studied, but appears to take place throughout the year, with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season.  ",1
6784,"Upon hatching, the young white stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish down feathers. ",0
6785,This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down. ,0
6786,"By three weeks, the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers. ",0
6787,"On hatching the chick has pinkish legs, which turn to greyish-black as it ages. ",0
6788,"By the time it fledges, the juvenile bird's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though its black feathers are often tinged with brown, and its beak and legs are a duller brownish-red or orange. ",0
6789,The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip.  ,1
6790,"The bills gain the adults' red colour the following summer, although the black tips persist in some individuals. ",0
6791,Within its range the white stork is distinctive when seen on the ground. ,0
6792,"The winter range of C. c. asiatica overlaps that of the Asian openbill, which has similar plumage but a different bill shape. ",0
6793,"When seen at a distance in flight, the white stork can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the yellow-billed stork, great white pelican and Egyptian vulture.  ",1
6794,"The yellow-billed stork is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak. ",0
6795,The white stork also tends to be larger than the yellow-billed stork.  ,1
6796,"The great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile.  ",1
6797,"Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the white stork does.  ",1
6798,"The Egyptian vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck.  ",1
6799,"The common crane, which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight.  ",1
6800,"The nominate race of the white stork has a wide although disjunct summer range across Europe, clustered in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the west, and much of eastern and central Europe, with 25% of the world's population concentrated in Poland,  as well as parts of western Asia. ",1
6801,The asiatica population of about 1450 birds is restricted to a region in central Asia between the Aral Sea and Xinjiang in western China.   ,1
6802,The Xinjiang population is believed to have become extinct around 1980.  Migration routes extend the range of this species into many parts of Africa and India. ,1
6803,"Some populations adhere to the eastern migration route, which passes across Israel into eastern and central Africa.   ",1
6804,"A few records of breeding from South Africa have been known since 1933 at Calitzdorp, and about 10 birds have been known to breed since the 1990s around Bredasdorp.  ",1
6805,A small population of white storks winters in India and is thought to derive principally from the C. c. asiatica population  as flocks of up to 200 birds have been observed on spring migration in the early 1900s through the Kurram Valley.  ,1
6806,"However, birds ringed in Germany have been recovered in western (Bikaner) and southern (Tirunelveli) India.   ",1
6807,"An atypical specimen with red orbital skin, a feature of the Oriental white stork, has been recorded  and further study of the Indian population is required.  ",1
6808,"North of the breeding range, it is a passage migrant or vagrant in Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden, and west to the Azores and Madeira. ",0
6809,"The white stork's preferred feeding grounds are grassy meadows, farmland and shallow wetlands. ",0
6810,"In the Chernobyl area of northern Ukraine, white stork populations declined after the 1986 nuclear accident there as farmland was succeeded by tall grass shrubs.  ",1
6811,"In parts of Poland, poor natural foraging grounds have forced birds to seek food at rubbish dumps since 1999.  White storks have also been reported foraging in rubbish dumps in the Middle East, North Africa and South Africa.  ",1
6812,"The white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands, particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded, and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland.  ",1
6813,"They make use of grasslands, wetlands, and farmland on the wintering grounds in Africa.  ",1
6814,"White storks were probably aided by human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created, and they were found across much of Europe, breeding as far north as Sweden. ",0
6815,The population in Sweden is thought to have established in the 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture. ,0
6816,About 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in the 18th century which declined subsequently. ,0
6817,The first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and the last pair failed to breed around 1955.  ,1
6818,"The white stork has been a rare visitor to the British Isles, with about 20 birds seen in Britain every year, and prior to 2020 there were no records of nesting since a pair nested atop St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1416.  ",1
6819,"In 2020, a pair bred in the United Kingdom for the first time in over 600 years,  as part of an re-introduction initiative called the White Stork Project.  A decline in population began in the 19th century due to industrialisation and changes in agricultural methods. ",1
6820,"White storks no longer nest in many countries, and the current strongholds of the western population are in Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. ",0
6821,"In the Iberian Peninsula, populations are concentrated in the southwest, and have also declined due to agricultural practices.  ",1
6822,"A study published in 2005 found that the Podhale region in the uplands of southern Poland had seen an influx of white storks, which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since, reaching 890 m (3000 ft) in 1999. ",0
6823,The authors proposed that this was related to climate warming and the influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes.  ,1
6824,"White storks arriving in PoznanÌ province (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in western Poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in the last twenty years of the 20th century than at the end of the 19th century.  Systematic research into migration of the white stork began with German ornithologist Johannes Thienemann who commenced bird ringing studies in 1906 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory, on the Curonian Spit in what was then East Prussia. ",1
6825,"Although not many storks passed through Rossitten itself, the observatory coordinated the large-scale ringing of the species throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe. ",0
6826,"Between 1906 and the Second World War about 100,000, mainly juvenile, white storks were ringed, with over 2,000 long-distance recoveries of birds wearing Rossitten rings reported between 1908 and 1954.  White storks fly south from their summer breeding grounds in Europe in August and September, heading for Africa.  ",1
6827,"There, they spend the winter in savannah from Kenya and Uganda south to the Cape Province of South Africa.  ",1
6828,In these areas they congregate in large flocks which may exceed a thousand individuals.  ,1
6829,"Some diverge westwards into western Sudan and Chad, and may reach Nigeria.  ",1
6830,"In spring, the birds return north; they are recorded from Sudan and Egypt from February to April.  ",1
6831,"They arrive back in Europe around late March and April,  after an average journey of 49 days. ",1
6832,"By comparison, the autumn journey is completed in about 26 days. ",0
6833,Tailwinds and scarcity of food and water en route (birds fly faster over regions lacking resources) increase average speed.  ,1
6834,"To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the Bosphorus to Turkey, traversing the Levant, then bypassing the Sahara Desert by following the Nile valley southwards, or follow a western route over the Strait of Gibraltar.  ",1
6835,These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy.   ,1
6836,"The eastern route is by far the more important with 530,000 white storks using it annually, making the species the second commonest migrant there (after the European honey buzzard). ",0
6837,"The flocks of migrating raptors, white storks and great white pelicans can stretch for 200 km (125 mi).  ",1
6838,"The eastern route is twice as long as the western, but storks take the same time to reach the wintering grounds by either.  ",1
6839,"Juvenile white storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but, if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions, they are unable to compensate, and may end up in a new wintering location. ",0
6840,"Adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites, because they are familiar with the location. ",0
6841,"For the same reason, all spring migrants, even those from displaced wintering locations, can find their way back to the traditional breeding sites.  ",1
6842,"An experiment with young birds raised in captivity in Kaliningrad and released in the absence of wild storks to show them the way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south, although the scatter in direction was large.  ",1
6843,White storks rely on the uplift of air thermals to soar and glide the long distances of their annual migrations between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. ,0
6844,"For many, the shortest route would take them over the Mediterranean Sea; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping.  ",1
6845,It has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled.  ,1
6846,"Thus, flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top, up to 1,200â1,500 m (3,900â4,900 ft) above the ground (though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of 3,300 m (10,800 ft)).  Long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken. ",1
6847,"A young white stork ringed at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England, where it spent some days before moving on. ",0
6848,"It was later seen flying over St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, and arrived in a poor condition in Madeira three days later. ",0
6849,"That island is 500 km (320 mi) from Africa, and twice as far from the European mainland.  Migration through the Middle East may be hampered by the khamsin, winds bringing gusty overcast days unsuitable for flying. ",1
6850,"In these situations, flocks of white storks sit out the adverse weather on the ground, standing and facing into the wind.  ",1
6851,The white stork is a gregarious bird; flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa. ,0
6852,Non-breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during the breeding season.  ,1
6853,The smaller dark-plumaged Abdim's stork is often encountered with white stork flocks in southern Africa.  ,1
6854,"Breeding pairs of white stork may gather in small groups to hunt, and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas.  ",1
6855,"However, groups among white stork colonies vary widely in size and the social structure is loosely defined; young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests, while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying the better quality nests toward the centres of breeding colonies.  Social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening. ",1
6856,"Standing birds preen the heads of sitting birds, sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles, and sometimes juveniles preen each other.  ",1
6857,"Unlike most storks, it never adopts a spread-winged posture, though it is known to droop its wings (holding them away from its body with the primary feathers pointing downwards) when its plumage is wet.  ",1
6858,"A white stork's droppings, containing faeces and uric acid, are sometimes directed onto its own legs, making them appear white.  ",1
6859,] Birds that have been ringed can sometimes be affected by the accumulation of droppings around the ring leading to constriction and leg trauma.  ,1
6860,The white stork has also been noted for tool use by squeezing moss in the beak to drip water into the mouths of its chicks.  ,1
6861,"The adult white stork's main sound is noisy bill-clattering, which has been likened to distant machine gun fire. ",0
6862,The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. ,0
6863,"The clattering is amplified by its throat pouch, which acts as a resonator. ",0
6864,"Used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situationâfor example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call. ",0
6865,"The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. ",0
6866,The up-down display is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. ,0
6867,"Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. ",0
6868,"The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a threat display. ",0
6869,"Breeding pairs are territorial over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.  ",1
6870,"The white stork breeds in open farmland areas with access to marshy wetlands, building a large stick nest in trees, on buildings, or on purpose-built man-made platforms.  ",1
6871,"Each nest is 1â2 m (3.3â6.6 ft) in depth, 0.8â1.5 m (2.6â4.9 ft) in diameter, and 60â250 kg (130â550 lb) in weight.  ",1
6872,"Nests are built in loose colonies.  Not persecuted as it is viewed as a good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. ",1
6873,The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. ,0
6874,The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests. ,0
6875,"Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged, and appear to be sought after.  ",1
6876,"Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year, and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites.  ",1
6877,"Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest, partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved.  ",1
6878,Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork. ,0
6879,"Regular occupants are house sparrows, tree sparrows, and common starlings; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels, little owls, European rollers, white wagtails, black redstarts, Eurasian jackdaws, and Spanish sparrows.  ",1
6880,"Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head.  Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. ",1
6881,"High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.  ",1
6882,"The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of one to seven have been recorded.  ",1
6883,"The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering. ",0
6884,"They typically measure 73 mm Ã 52 mm (2.9 in Ã 2.0 in),  and weigh 96â129 g (3.4â4.6 oz),  of which about 11 g (0.39 oz) is shell.  ",1
6885,"Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the brood hatches asynchronously, beginning 33 to 34 days later. ",0
6886,The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. ,0
6887,"While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents.   ",1
6888,This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. ,0
6889,"White stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. ",0
6890,The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates.  ,1
6891,"Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates.  ",1
6892,The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about 3.4 kg (7.5 lb) in 45 days. ,0
6893,The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50 days.  ,1
6894,"Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects, which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest. ",0
6895,Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food.  ,1
6896,"White storks generally begin breeding when about four years old, although the age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years.  ",1
6897,"The oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in Switzerland,  while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years.  ",1
6898,They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5 km (3 mi) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible.  ,1
6899,"Common food items include insects (primarily beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets), earthworms, reptiles, amphibians, particularly frog species such as the edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) and common frog (Rana temporaria) and small mammals such as voles, moles and shrews. ",0
6900,"Less commonly, they also eat bird eggs and young birds, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and scorpions. ",0
6901,"They hunt mainly during the day, swallowing small prey whole, but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing.[68 ",0
6902,"] Rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed, occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of the digestive tract.[92 ",0
6903,"] Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey, moor frogs (Rana arvalis), by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs.  ",1
6904,"The diet of non-breeding birds is similar to that of breeding birds, but food items are more often taken from dry areas.  ",1
6905,White storks wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them.  ,1
6906,"Wintering white storks in India sometimes forage along with the woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus).  Food piracy has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork, while Montagu's harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of Poland. [98 ",1
6907,"] White storks can exploit landfill sites for food during the breeding season, migration period and winter.  ",1
6908,"White stork nests are habitats for an array of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. ",0
6909,"Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. ",0
6910,"Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living mesostigmatic mites. ",0
6911,"A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being Macrocheles merdarius, M. robustulus, Uroobovella pyriformis and Trichouropoda orbicularis, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. ",0
6912,"These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes, which are abundant in the nest litter. ",0
6913,"These mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles, often of the family Scarabaeidae, or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. ",0
6914,"Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. ",0
6915,"The overall effect of the mite population is unclear, the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.   ",1
6916,The birds themselves host species belonging to more than four genera of feather mites.  ,1
6917,"These mites, including Freyanopterolichus pelargicus   and Pelargolichus didactylus  live on fungi growing on the feathers. ",1
6918,"The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.  Chewing lice such as Colpocephalum zebra tend to be found on the wings, and Neophilopterus incompletus elsewhere on the body.  ",1
6919,"The white stork also carries several types of internal parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii  and intestinal parasites of the genus Giardia.  ",1
6920,"A study of 120 white stork carcasses from Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg in Germany yielded eight species of trematode (fluke), four cestode (tapeworm) species, and at least three species of nematode.  ",1
6921,"One species of fluke, Chaunocephalus ferox, caused lesions in the wall of the small intestine in a number of birds admitted to two rehabilitation centres in central Spain, and was associated with reduced weight. ",0
6922,It is a recognised pathogen and cause of morbidity in the Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans).  ,1
6923,"More recently, the thorough study performed by J. Sitko and P. Heneberg in the Czech Republic in 1962â2013 suggested that the central European white storks host 11 helminth species. ",0
6924,", Tylodelphys excavata and Dictymetra discoidea were reported to be the dominant ones. ",0
6925,"The other species found included Cathaemasia hians, Echinochasmus spinulosus, Echinostoma revolutum, Echinostoma sudanense, Duboisia syriaca, Apharyngostrigea cornu, Capillaria sp. and Dictymetra discoidea. ",0
6926,"Juvenile white storks were shown to host less species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult storks.  West Nile virus (WNV) is mainly a bird infection that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos.  ",1
6927,"Migrating birds appear to be important in spread of the virus,  the ecology of which remains poorly known.  ",1
6928,"On 26 August 1998, a flock of about 1,200 migrating white storks that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in Eilat, in southern Israel. ",0
6929,"The flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route, and a number of birds died. ",0
6930,A virulent strain of West Nile virus was isolated from the brains of eleven dead juveniles. ,0
6931,Other white storks subsequently tested in Israel have shown anti-WNV antibodies.  ,1
6932,"In 2008 three juvenile white storks from a Polish wildlife refuge yielded seropositive results indicating exposure to the virus, but the context or existence of the virus in Poland is unclear.  ",1
6933,"The white stork's decline due to industrialisation and agricultural changes (principally the draining of wetlands and conversion of meadows to crops such as maize) began in the 19th century: the last wild individual in Belgium was seen in 1895, in Sweden in 1955, in Switzerland in 1950 and in the Netherlands in 1991. ",0
6934,"It has been rated as least concern by the IUCN since 1994, after being evaluated as near threatened in 1988.  ",1
6935,The white stork is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ,0
6936,(AEWA) applies.  Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. ,1
6937,"The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.  ",1
6938,"Threats include the continued loss of wetlands, collisions with overhead power lines, use of persistent pesticides (such as DDT) to combat locusts in Africa, and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds.  ",1
6939,"A large population of white storks breeds in central (Poland, Ukraine and Germany) and southern Europe (Spain and Turkey). ",0
6940,"In a 2004/05 census, there were 52,500 pairs in Poland, 30,000 pairs in Ukraine, 20,000 pairs in Belarus, 13,000 pairs in Lithuania (the highest known density of this species in the world), 10,700 pairs in Latvia, and 10,200 in Russia. ",0
6941,"There were around 5,500 pairs in Romania, 5,300 in Hungary and an estimated 4,956 breeding pairs in Bulgaria.  ",1
6942,"In Germany, the majority of the total 4,482 pairs were in the eastern region, especially in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (1296 and 863 pairs in 2008 respectively).  ",1
6943,"Apart from Spain and Portugal (33,217 and 7,684 pairs in 2004/05 respectively), populations are generally much less stable. ",0
6944,"In the eastern Mediterranean region Turkey has a sizeable population of 6,195 pairs, and Greece 2,139 pairs. ",0
6945,In Western Europe the white stork remains a rare bird despite conservation efforts. ,0
6946,"In 2004 France had only 973 pairs, and the Netherlands 528 pairs.  ",1
6947,"In Armenia the population of the white stork slightly increased in the period between 2005 and 2015, and by last data reached 652 pairs.    ",1
6948,"In the early 1980s, the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper Rhine River valley, an area closely identified with the white stork for centuries. ",0
6949,"Conservation efforts successfully increased the population of birds there to 270 pairs (in 2008), largely due to the actions of the Association for the Protection and Reintroduction of Storks in Alsace and Lorraine.  ",1
6950,"The reintroduction of zoo-reared birds has halted further declines in Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. ",0
6951,"There were 601 pairs breeding in Armenia and around 700 pairs in the Netherlands in 2008,  and few pairs also breed in South Africa, typically recent colonists from within the normal wintering population.  ",1
6952,"In Poland, electric poles have been modified with a platform at the top to prevent the white stork's large nest from disrupting the electricity supply, and sometimes nests are moved from an electric pole to a man-made platform.  Introductions of zoo-reared birds in the Netherlands has been followed up by feeding and nest-building programs by volunteers.  ",1
6953,"Similar reintroduction programs are taking place in Sweden,  and Switzerland,  where 175 pairs were recorded breeding in 2000.  ",1
6954,"Long-term viability of the population in Switzerland is unclear as breeding success rates are low, and supplementary feeding does not appear to be of benefit.  ",1
6955,"However, as of 2017, 470 adults and 757 young ones were recorded in Switzerland.  ",1
6956,"In August 2019, 24 juveniles were released at the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, and others at a site near Tunbridge Wells and at the Wintershall Estate, near Godalming, as part of a project to reintroduce the white stork as a breeding species in South East England,  for the first time since 1416.  ",1
6957,"In 2020, the program was successful with the birth of five baby storks.  ",1
6958,"Due to its large size, predation on vermin, and nesting behaviour close to human settlements and on rooftops, the white stork has an imposing presence that has influenced human culture and folklore.  ",1
6959,"The Hebrew word for the white stork is chasidah (××¡×××), meaning ""merciful"" or ""kind"".  ",1
6960,Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion. ,0
6961,"The 3rd century Roman writer Aelian citing the authority of Alexander of Myndus noted in his De natura animalium (book 3, chapter 23) that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents.  ",1
6962,The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop's Fables: ,0
6963,"The Fox and the Stork, The Farmer and the Stork, and The Frogs ",0
6964,"Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children's books depicted them as a model of filial values. ",0
6965,"A Greek law called Pelargonia, from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents.  ",1
6966,"The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death.  Storks were allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as they hunted snakes, and widely held to be Virgil's ""white bird"".  Roman writers noted the white stork's arrival in spring, which alerted farmers to plant their vines.  Followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage to Mecca on their migration.  ",1
6967,Some of the earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in white storks; ,0
6968,"(""arrow storks"") were found in Europe with African arrows embedded in their bodies. ",0
6969,"A well-known example of such a stork found in the summer of 1822 in the German town of KluÌtz in Mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen, complete with the ornate African arrow, that is now in the University of Rostock.[139 ",0
6970,"] Storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed, and often nest on buildings in Europe. ",0
6971,"In Germany, the presence of a nest on a house was believed to protect against fires. ",0
6972,"They were also protected because of the belief that their souls were human.  German, Dutch and Polish households would encourage storks to nest on houses, sometimes by constructing purpose-built high platforms, to bring good luck.  ",1
6973,Across much of Central and Eastern Europe it is believed that storks bring harmony to a family on whose property they nest.  ,1
6974,"The white stork is a popular motif on postage stamps, and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp-issuing entities.  ",1
6975,"It is the national bird of Lithuania, Belarus  and Poland, and it was a Polish mascot at the Expo 2000 Fair in Hanover.  ",1
6976,"Storks nesting in Polish villages such as ZÌywkowo have made them tourist attractions, drawing 2000â5000 visitors a year in 2014.  ",1
6977,"In the 19th century, storks were also thought to only live in countries having a republican form of government.  Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid mentioned storks in his poem Moja piosnka (II) (""My Song (II)""):  ",1
6978,"For the land where it's a great travestyTo harm a stork's nest in a pear tree,For storks serve us all ",0
6979,In 1942 Heinrich Himmler sought to use storks to carry Nazi propaganda leaflets so as to win support from the Boers in South Africa. ,0
6980,"The idea for this ""Storchbein-Propaganda"" plan was a secret that was transmitted by Walter Schellenberg to be examined by the German ornithologist Ernst SchuÌz at the Rossiten bird observatory, who pointed out that the probability of finding marked storks in Africa was less than one percent, requiring a 1000 birds to transmit 10 leaflets successfully. ",0
6981,"According to European folklore, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. ",0
6982,"The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by a 19th-century Hans Christian Andersen story called ""The Storks"".  ",1
6983,German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. ,0
6984,The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. ,0
6985,Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill.  ,1
6986,"From there the folklore has spread around the world to the Philippines and countries in South America.  Birthmarks on the back of the head of newborn baby, nevus flammeus nuchae, are sometimes referred to as stork-bite.  ",1
6987,"In Slavic mythology and pagan religion, storks were thought to carry unborn souls from Vyraj to Earth in spring and summer.  ",1
6988,"This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that ""storks bring children into the world"".  ",1
6989,"Storks were seen by Early Slavs as bringing luck, and killing one would bring misfortune.  ",1
6990,A long-term study that showed a spurious correlation between the numbers of stork nests and human births is widely used in the teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation.   ,1
6991,"Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs.  ",1
6992,"Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. ",0
6993,"Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size (in that it is big enough to carry an infant), and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).  ",1
6994,The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud  and Carl Jung.  ,1
6995,"In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister.  ",1
6996,The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as nappies and baby announcements.  ,1
6997,"There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork's plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. ",0
6998,"They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. ",0
6999,"A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been ""bitten"" by the stork.  ",1
7000,"In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years.  ",1
7001,"In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. ",0
7002,"Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit.[159The white swamphen (Porphyrio albus), also known as the Lord Howe swamphen, Lord Howe gallinule, or white gallinule, is an extinct species of rail which lived on Lord Howe Island, east of Australia. ",0
7003,"It was first encountered when the crews of British ships visited the island between 1788 and 1790, and all contemporary accounts and illustrations were produced during this time. ",0
7004,"Today, two specimens exist: the holotype in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, and another in Liverpool's World Museum. ",0
7005,"Although historical confusion has existed about the provenance of the specimens and the classification and anatomy of the bird, it is now thought to have been a distinct species endemic to Lord Howe Island and most similar to the Australasian swamphen. ",0
7006,The white swamphen was 36 cm (14 in) to 55 cm (22 in) long. ,0
7007,"Both known skins have mainly-white plumage, although the Liverpool specimen also has dispersed blue feathers. ",0
7008,"This is unlike other swamphens, but contemporary accounts indicate birds with all-white, all-blue, and mixed blue-and-white plumage. ",0
7009,"The chicks were black, becoming blue and then white as they aged. ",0
7010,"Although this has been interpreted as due to albinism, it may have been progressive greying in which feathers lose their pigment with age. ",0
7011,"The bird's bill, frontal shield and legs were red, and it had a claw (or spur) on its wing. ",0
7012,"It may not have been flightless, but was probably a poor flier. ",0
7013,"This and its docility made the bird easy prey for visiting humans, who killed it with sticks. ",0
7014,"Reportedly once common, the species may have been hunted to extinction before 1834, when Lord Howe Island was settled. ",0
7015,"Lord Howe Island is a small, remote island about 600 kilometres (370 mi) east of Australia. ",0
7016,"Ships first arrived on the island in 1788, including two which supplied the British penal colony on Norfolk Island and three transport ships of the British First Fleet. ",0
7017,"When HMS Supply passed the island, the ship's commander named it after First Lord of the Admiralty Richard Howe. ",0
7018,"Crews of the visiting ships captured native birds (including white swamphens), and all contemporary descriptions and depictions of the species were made between 1788 and 1790. ",0
7019,"The bird was first mentioned by the master of HMS Supply, David Blackburn, in a 1788 letter to a friend. ",0
7020,"Other accounts and illustrations were produced by Arthur Bowes Smyth, the fleet's naval officer and surgeon who drew the first known illustration of the species; Arthur Phillip, governor of New South Wales; and George Raper, midshipman of HMS Sirius. ",0
7021,"Secondhand accounts also exist, and at least ten contemporary illustrations are known. ",0
7022,"The accounts indicate that the population varied, and individual bird plumage was white, blue, or mixed blue-and-white.   ",1
7023,"In 1790, the white swamphen was scientifically described and named by the surgeon John White in a book about his time in New South Wales. ",0
7024,"He named the bird Fulica alba, the specific name being derived from the Latin word for white (albus). ",0
7025,"Although he apparently never visited Lord Howe Island, White may have questioned sailors and based some of his description on earlier accounts. ",0
7026,"He said he had described a skin at the Leverian Museum, and his book included an illustration of the specimen by the artist Sarah Stone. ",0
7027,It is uncertain when (and how) the specimen arrived at the museum. ,0
7028,"This skin, the holotype specimen of the species, was purchased by the Natural History Museum of Vienna in 1806 and is catalogued as specimen NMW 50.761. ",0
7029,"The naturalist John Latham listed the bird as Gallinula alba in a later 1790 work, and wrote that it may have been a variety of purple swamphen (or ""gallinule"").    ",1
7030,"One other white swamphen specimen is in Liverpool's World Museum, where it is catalogued as specimen WML D3213. ",0
7031,"Obtained by the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, it later entered the collection of the traveller William Bullock and was purchased by Lord Stanley; Stanley's son donated it to Liverpool's public museums in 1850. ",0
7032,"Although White said that the first specimen was obtained from Lord Howe Island, the provenance of the second has been unclear; it was originally said to have come from New Zealand, resulting in taxonomic confusion. ",0
7033,"Phillip wrote that the bird could also be found on Norfolk Island and elsewhere, but Latham said it could be found only on Norfolk Island. ",0
7034,"When the first specimen was sold by the Leverian Museum, it was listed as coming from New Holland (which Australia was called at the time)âperhaps because it was sent from Sydney.   ",1
7035,"A note by the naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard on a contemporary illustration of the bird by Captain John Hunter inaccurately stated that it only lived on Ball's Pyramid, an islet off Lord Howe Island.   ",1
7036,"The Zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck assigned the white swamphen to the swamphen genus Porphyrio as P. albus in 1820, and the zoologist George Robert Gray considered it an albino variety of the Australasian swamphen (P. melanotus) as P. m. varius alba in 1844. ",0
7037,"The belief that the bird was simply an albino was held by several later writers, and many failed to notice that White cited Lord Howe Island as the origin of the Vienna specimen.   ",1
7038,"In 1860 and 1873, the ornithologist August von Pelzeln said that the Vienna specimen had come from Norfolk Island, and assigned the species to the genus Notornis as N. alba; the takaheÌ (P. hochstetteri) of New Zealand was also placed in that genus at the time.   ",1
7039,"In 1873, the naturalist Osbert Salvin agreed that the Lord Howe Island bird was similar to the takaheÌ, although he had apparently never seen the Vienna specimen, basing his conclusion on a drawing provided by von Pelzeln. ",0
7040,"Salvin included a takaheÌ-like illustration of the Vienna specimen by the artist John Gerrard Keulemans, based on von Pelzeln's drawing, in his article.   ",1
7041,"In 1875, the ornithologist George Dawson Rowley noted differences between the Vienna and Liverpool specimens and named a new species based on the latter: ",0
7042,"He believed that the Liverpool specimen was a juvenile from Lord Howe Island or New Zealand, and continued to believe that the Vienna specimen was from Norfolk Island. ",0
7043,"Despite naming the new species, Rowley considered the possibility that P. stanleyi was an albino Australasian swamphen and considered the Vienna bird more similar to the takaheÌ.  ",1
7044,"In 1901, the ornithologist Henry Ogg Forbes had the Liverpool specimen dismounted so he could examine it for damage. ",0
7045,"Forbes found it similar enough to the Vienna specimen to belong to the same species, N. alba.  ",1
7046,"The zoologist Walter Rothschild considered the two species distinct from each other in 1907, but placed them both in the genus Notornis. ",0
7047,"Rothschild thought that the image published by Phillip in 1789 depicted N. stanleyi from Lord Howe Island, and the image published by White in 1790 showed N. alba from Norfolk Island. ",0
7048,"He disagreed that the specimens were albinos, thinking instead that they were evolving into a white species. ",0
7049,"Rothschild published an illustration of N. alba by Keulemans where it is similar to a takaheÌ, inaccurately showing it with dark primary feathers, although the Vienna specimen on which it was based is all white.  ",1
7050,"In 1910, the ornithologist Tom Iredale demonstrated that there was no proof of the white swamphen existing anywhere but on Lord Howe Island and noted that early visitors to Norfolk Island (such as Captain James Cook and Lieutenant Philip Gidley King) did not mention the bird.  ",1
7051,"In 1913, after examining the Vienna specimen, Iredale concluded that the bird belonged in the genus Porphyrio and did not resemble the takaheÌ.  ",1
7052,"In 1928, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews discussed a 1790 painting by Raper which he thought differed enough from P. albus in proportions and colouration that he named a new species based on it: P. raperi. ",0
7053,"Mathews also considered P. albus distinct enough to warrant a new genus, Kentrophorina, due to having a (or spur) on one wing.  ",1
7054,"In 1936, he conceded that P. raperi was a synonym of P. albus.  ",1
7055,"The ornithologist Keith Alfred Hindwood agreed that the bird was an albino P. melanotus in 1932, and pointed out that the naturalists Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster (his son) did not record the bird when Cook's ship visited Norfolk Island in 1774. ",0
7056,"In 1940, Hindwood found the white swamphen so closely related to the Australasian swamphen that he considered them subspecies of the same species: P. albus albus and P. albus melanotus (since albus is the older name). ",0
7057,"Hindwood suggested that the population on Lord Howe Island was white; blue Australasian swamphens occasionally arrived (stragglers from elsewhere have been found on the island) and bred with the white birds, accounting for the blue and partially-blue individuals in the old accounts. ",0
7058,He also pointed out that Australasian swamphens are prone to white feathering.   ,1
7059,"In 1941, the biologist Ernst Mayr proposed that the white swamphen was a partially-albinistic population of Australasian swamphens. ",0
7060,"Mayr suggested that the blue swamphens remaining on Lord Howe Island were not stragglers, but had survived because they were less conspicuous than the white ones.  ",1
7061,"In 1967, the ornithologist James Greenway also considered the white swamphen a subspecies (with P. stanleyi a synonym) and considered the white individuals albinos. ",0
7062,He suggested that the similarities between the wing feathers of the white swamphen and the takaheÌ were due to parallel evolution in two isolated populations of reluctant fliers.  ,1
7063,"The ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley found the white swamphen to be intermediate between the takaheÌ and the purple swamphen in 1977, based on patterns of the leg-scutes, and reported that X-rays of bones also showed similarities with the takaheÌ. ",0
7064,"He considered only the Vienna specimen to be a white swamphen, whereas he considered the Liverpool specimen to be an albino Australasian swamphen (listing P. stanleyi  as a junior synonym of that bird) from New Zealand.  ",1
7065,"In 1991, the ornithologist Ian Hutton reported subfossil bones of the white swamphen. ",0
7066,"Hutton agreed that the birds described as having white-and-blue feathers were hybrids between the white swamphen and the Australasian swamphen, an idea also considered by the ornithologists Barry Taylor and Ber van Perlo in 2000.  ",1
7067,"In 2000, the writer Errol Fuller said that since swamphens are widespread colonists, it would be expected that populations would evolve similarly to the takaheÌ when they found refuges without mammals (losing flight and becoming bulkier with stouter legs, for example); this was the case with the white swamphen. ",0
7068,"Fuller suggested that they could be called ""white takaheÌs"", which had been alluded to earlier; the white birds may have been a colour morph of the population, or the blue birds may have been Australasian swamphens which associated with the white birds.  ",1
7069,"In 2015, the biologists Juan C. Garcia-R. and Steve A. Trewick analysed the DNA of the purple swamphens. ",0
7070,"They found that the white swamphen was most closely related to the Philippine swamphen (P. pulverulentus), and the black-backed swamphen (P. indicus) more closely related to both than to other species in its region. ",0
7071,"Garcia-R. and Trewick used DNA from the Vienna specimen, but were unable to obtain usable DNA from the Liverpool specimen. ",0
7072,"They suggested that the white swamphen may have descended from a few migrant Philippine swamphens during the late Pleistocene (about 500,000 years ago), dispersing over other islands. ",0
7073,"This indicates a complex history, since their lineages are not recorded on the islands between them; according to the biologists, such results (based on ancient DNA sources) should be treated with caution. ",0
7074,"Although many purple swamphen taxa had been considered subspecies of the species P. porphyrio, they considered this a paraphyletic (unnatural) grouping since they found different species to group among the subspecies.   ",1
7075,"The ornithologists Hein van Grouw and Julian P. Hume concluded in 2016 that many of the old accounts had errors in the bird's provenance, that it was endemic to Lord Howe Island, and suggested when the specimens were collected (between March and May 1788) and under which circumstances they arrived in England. ",0
7076,"They concluded that the white swamphen was a valid species which changed colouration with age, after reconstructing the colouration of juvenile birds before turning white (which was distinct from other swamphens). ",0
7077,"Van Grouw and Hume found the white swamphen anatomically more similar to the Australasian swamphen than the Philippine swamphen, and suggested that studies with more-complete data sets than the earlier DNA might yield different results. ",0
7078,"Due to their anatomical similarities, geographic proximity and the recolonisation of Lord Howe and Norfolk Island by Australasian swamphens, they found it likely that the white swamphen was descended from Australasian swamphens.  ",1
7079,"The length of the white swamphen has been given as 36 cm (14 in) and 55 cm (22 in), making it similar to the Australasian swamphen in size. ",0
7080,"The wing of the Vienna specimen is 218 mm (9 in) mm long, the tail is 73.3 mm (3 in), the culmen with its frontal shield (the fleshy plate on the head) is 79 mm (3 in), the tarsus is 86 mm (3 in), and the middle toe is 77.7 mm (3 in) long. ",0
7081,"The wing of the Liverpool specimen is 235 mm (9 in) long, the tarsus is 88.4 mm (3 in) and the middle toe is 66.5 mm (3 in). ",0
7082,"Its tail and beak are damaged, and cannot be reliably measured. ",0
7083,"The white swamphen differed from most other swamphens (except the Australasian swamphen) in having a short middle toe; it is the same length as the tarsus, or longer, in other species. ",0
7084,"Both specimens have a claw (or spur) on their wings; it is longer and more discernible in the Vienna specimen, and sharp and buried in the feathers of the Liverpool specimen. ",0
7085,The softness of the rectrices (tail feathers) and the lengths of the secondary and wing covert feathers relative to the primary feathers appear to have been intermediate between those of the purple swamphen and the takaheÌ.  ,1
7086,"Although the known skins are mostly white, contemporary illustrations depict some blue individuals; others had a mixture of white and blue feathers. ",0
7087,"Their legs were red or yellow, but the latter colour may be present only on dried specimens. ",0
7088,"The bill and frontal shield were red, and the iris was red or brown. ",0
7089,"According to notes written on an illustration by an unknown artist (in the collection of the artist Thomas Watling, inaccurately dated 1792), the chicks were black and became bluish-grey and then white as they matured. ",0
7090,"The Vienna specimen is pure white, but the Liverpool specimen has yellowish reflections on its neck and breast, blackish-blue feathers speckled on the head (concentrated near the upper surface of the shield) and neck, blue feathers on the breast, and purplish-blue feathers on the shoulders, back, scapular and lesser covert feathers. ",0
7091,"Some of the rectrices (tail feathers) are purplish-brown, and some of the scapular feathers and those on the mid-back are sooty-brown at the base and sooty-blue further up. ",0
7092,"This colouration indicates that the Liverpool specimen was a younger bird than the Vienna specimen, and the latter had reached the final stage of maturity. ",0
7093,"Since the Liverpool specimen preserves some of its original colour, van Grouw and Hume were able to reconstruct its natural colouration before becoming white. ",0
7094,"It differed from other swamphens in having blackish-blue lores, forehead, crown, nape and hind neck, purple-blue mantle, back, and wings, a darker rump and upper-tail covert feathers, and dark greyish-blue underparts.      ",1
7095,"Phillip gave a detailed description in 1789, possibly based on a live bird he received in Sydney: This beautiful bird greatly resembles the purple Gallinule in shape and make, but is much superior in size, being as large as a dunghill fowl. ",0
7096,"The length from the end of the bill to that of the claws is two feet three inches; the bill is very stout, and the colour of it, the whole top of the head, and the irides red; the sides of the head around the eyes are reddish, very thinly sprinkled with white feathers; the whole of the plumage without exception is white. ",0
7097,"This species is pretty common on Lord Howeâs Island, Norfolk Island, and other places, and is a very tame species. ",0
7098,"The other sex, supposed to be the male, is said to have some blue on the wings.  ",1
7099,"The Vienna specimen is today a study skin with its legs outstretched (not a taxidermy mount), but van Grouw and Hume suggested that Stone's 1790 illustration showed its original mounted pose. ",0
7100,"It is in good condition; although the legs are faded to a pale orange-brown, they were probably reddish in the living bird. ",0
7101,"Forbes suggested that the Liverpool specimen was ""remade"" and mounted after Stone's illustration, though its present pose is dissimilar. ",0
7102,"Keuleman's illustration of the mount shows the present pose, so Forbes was either incorrect or a new pose was based on Keuleman's image. ",0
7103,"The Liverpool specimen is in good condition, although it has lost some feathers from its head and neck. ",0
7104,"The bill is broken, and its rhamphotheca (the keratinous covering of the bill) is missing; the underlying bone was painted red to simulate an undamaged bill, which has caused some confusion. ",0
7105,"The legs have also been painted red, and there is no indication of their original colouration. ",0
7106,The reason only white specimens are known today may be collecting bias; unusually-coloured specimens are more likely to be collected than normally-coloured ones.      ,1
7107,"Nothing was recorded about its social and reproductive behaviour and its nest, eggs and call were never described. ",0
7108,Blackburn's 1788 account is the only one that mentions the diet of this bird: ,0
7109,"On the shore we caught several sorts of birds   and a white fowl â something like a Guinea hen, with a very strong thick & sharp pointed bill of a red colour â stout legs and claws â I believe they are carnivorous they hold their food between the thumb or hind claw & the bottom of the foot & lift it to the mouth without stopping so much as a parrot.  ",1
7110,"Rowley considered the Liverpool specimen (representing the separate species P. stanleyi) capable of flight, due to its longer wings; Rothschild believed that both were flightless, although he was inconsistent about whether their wings were the same length. ",0
7111,"Van Grouw and Hume found that both specimens showed evidence of an increased terrestrial lifestyle (including decreased wing length, more robust feet and short toes), and were in the process of becoming flightless. ",0
7112,"Although it may still have been capable of flight, it was behaviourally flightless, similar to other island birds, such as some parrots. ",0
7113,"Though the white swamphen was similar in size to the Australasian swamphen, it had proportionally shorter wings and therefore a higher wing load â perhaps the highest of all swamphens.    ",1
7114,"Van Grouw and Hume pointed out that a white colour aberration in birds is rarely caused by albinism (which is less common than formerly believed), but by leucism or progressive greying â a phenomenon van Grouw described in 2012 and 2013. ",0
7115,These conditions produce white feathers due to the absence of cells which produce the pigment melanin. ,0
7116,"Leucism is inherited, and the white feathering is present in juveniles and does not change with age; progressive greying causes normally-coloured juveniles to lose pigment-producing cells with age, and they become white as they moult. ",0
7117,"Since contemporary accounts indicate that the white swamphen turned from black to bluish-grey and then white, Van Grouw and Hume concluded that it underwent inheritable progressive greying. ",0
7118,"Progressive greying is a common cause of white feathers in many types of birds (including rails), although such specimens have sometimes been inaccurately referred to as albinos. ",0
7119,"The condition does not affect carotenoid pigments (red and yellow), and the bill and legs of the white swamphens retained their colouration. ",0
7120,"The large number of white individuals on Lord Howe Island may be due to its small founding population, which would have facilitated the spread of inheritable progressive greying.    ",1
7121,"Although the white swamphen was considered common during the late 18th century, it appears to have disappeared quickly; the period from the island's discovery to the last mention of living birds is only two years (1788â90). ",0
7122,"It had probably vanished by 1834, when Lord Howe Island was first settled, or during the following decade. ",0
7123,"Whalers and sealers had used the island for supplies, and may have hunted the bird to extinction. ",0
7124,"Habitat destruction probably did not play a role, and animal predators (such as rats and cats) arrived later.    ",1
7125,"Several contemporary accounts stress the ease with which the island's birds were hunted, and the large number which could be taken to provision ships.  ",1
7126,"In 1789, White described how the white swamphen could be caught: Theysailors] also found on it, in great plenty, a kind of fowl, resembling much of the Guinea fowl in shape and size, but widely different in colour; they being in general all white, with a red fleshy substance rising, like a cockâs comb, from the head, and not unlike a piece of sealing-wax. ",0
7127,"These not being birds of flight, nor in the least wild, the sailors availing themselves of their gentleness and inability to take wing from their pursuits, easily struck them down with sticks.  ",1
7128,"The fact that they could be killed with sticks may have been due to their poor flying ability, which would have made them vulnerable to human predation. ",0
7129,"With no natural enemies on the island, they were tame and curious.    ",1
7130,"The physician John Foulis, who conducted a mid-1840s ornithological survey on the island, did not mention the bird, so it must have been extinct by that time.  ",1
7131,"In 1909, the writer Arthur Francis Basset Hull expressed a hope that the bird still survived in unexplored mountains.  ",1
7132,"Eight types of bird have become extinct due to human interference since Lord Howe Island was discovered, including the Lord Howe pigeon (Columba vitiensis godmanae), the Lord Howe parakeet (Cyanoramphus subflavescens), the Lord Howe gerygone (Gerygone insularis), the Lord Howe fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina), the Lord Howe thrush (Turdus poliocephalus vinitinctus), the robust white-eye (Zosterops strenuus) and the Lord Howe starling (Aplonis fusca hulliana). ",0
7133,"The extinction of so many native birds is similar to extinctions on several other islands, such as the Mascarenes.[3 Ichthyaetus blagrus Blyth, 1843 ",0
7134,"The white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), also known as the white-breasted sea eagle, is a large diurnal bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. ",0
7135,"Originally described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands, and the two are considered a superspecies. ",0
7136,"A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. ",0
7137,The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. ,0
7138,The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. ,0
7139,"Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) long with a wingspan of up to 2.2 m (7.2 ft), and weigh 4.5 kg (9.9 lb). ",0
7140,"Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. ",0
7141,"Resident from India and Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia to Australia on coasts and major waterways, the white-bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around half of its diet. ",0
7142,"Although rated as Least Concern globally, it has declined in parts of southeast Asia such as Thailand, and southeastern Australia. ",0
7143,It is ranked as Threatened in Victoria and Vulnerable in South Australia and Tasmania. ,0
7144,"Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat, both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success, and from removal of suitable trees for nesting. ",0
7145,"The white-bellied sea eagle is revered by indigenous people in many parts of Australia, and is the subject of various folk tales throughout its range. ",0
7146,"The white-bellied sea eagle was first described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, although John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java during Captain Cook's last voyage.  ",1
7147,"Its specific name is derived from the Ancient Greek leuko- 'white',  and gaster 'belly'.  ",1
7148,Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. ,0
7149,"These form a superspecies, and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies, one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. ",0
7150,"The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. ",0
7151,"Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. ",0
7152,The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. ,0
7153,"Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. ",0
7154,"The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species.  Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands.   ",1
7155,"The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities beyond the Sanford's sea eagle are a little less clear; molecular data indicate that it is one of four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African fish eagle and the Madagascar fish eagle), while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere.   ",1
7156,A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).  ,1
7157,"As well as white-bellied sea eagle and white-breasted sea eagle, other recorded names include white-bellied fish-hawk, white-eagle,  and grey-backed sea eagle.  ",1
7158,"The white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, rump and underparts, and dark or slate-grey back and wings. ",0
7159,"In flight, the black flight feathers on the wings are easily seen when the bird is viewed from below. ",0
7160,"The large, hooked bill is a leaden blue-grey with a darker tip, and the irides are dark brown. ",0
7161,"The legs and feet are yellow or grey, with long black talons (claws). ",0
7162,"Unlike those of eagles of the genus Aquila, the legs are not feathered. ",0
7163,Males are 66â80 cm (26â31 in) long and weigh 1.8â3 kg (4.0â6.6 lb). ,0
7164,"Females are slightly larger, at 80â90 cm (31â35 in) and 2.5â4.5 kg (5.5â9.9 lb). ",0
7165,The wingspan ranges from 1.78 to 2.2 m (5.8 to 7.2 ft).    ,1
7166,"A 2004 study on 37 birds from Australia and Papua New Guinea (3 Â°S to 50 Â°S) found that birds could be sexed reliably on size, and that birds from latitudes further south were larger than those from the north.  ",1
7167,The moulting pattern of the white-bellied sea eagle is poorly known. ,0
7168,"It appears to take longer than a year to complete, and can be interrupted and later resumed from the point of interruption.  ",1
7169,"The wings are modified when gliding so that they rise from the body at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan. ",0
7170,"In silhouette, the comparatively long neck, head and beak stick out from the front almost as far as the tail does behind. ",0
7171,"For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.  ",1
7172,"A young white-bellied sea eagle in its first year is predominantly brown,  with pale cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas.  ",1
7173,The plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the fourth or fifth year.  ,1
7174,"The loud goose-like honking call is a familiar sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison,  and often carry on for some time when perched. ",1
7175,The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. ,0
7176,"Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in stark contrast to the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.  ",1
7177,Adult white-bellied sea eagles are unmistakable and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. ,0
7178,"However, the plumage of the latter is darker, the tail longer, and the legs feathered. ",0
7179,"They might also be confused with the black-breasted buzzard (Hamirostra melanosternon), but this species is much smaller, has white patches on the wings, and has a more undulating flight.[22In India, the Egyptian vulture has white plumage, but is smaller and has a whiter back and wings. ",0
7180,The white tail of the white-bellied sea eagle in flight distinguishes it from other species of large eagles.  ,1
7181,"In the Philippines, it can be confused with the Philippine eagle, which can be distinguished by its crest; immature white-bellied sea eagles resemble immature grey-headed fish eagles, but can be identified by their more wholly dark brown underparts and flight feathers, and wedge-shaped tail.  ",1
7182,"The white-bellied sea eagle is found regularly from Mumbai (sometimes north to Gujarat,  and in the past in the Lakshadweep Islands) eastwards in India,   ",1
7183,"Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka in southern Asia, through all of coastal Southeast Asia including Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Indochina,  the main and offshore islands of the Philippines,  and southern China including Hong Kong,[20 ",1
7184,"] Hainan and Fuzhou,  eastwards through New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago,  and Australia. ",1
7185,"In the northern Solomons it is restricted to Nissan Island,  and replaced elsewhere by Sanford's sea eagle.  ",1
7186,"In Victoria, where it is otherwise scarce, it is locally more common at Corner Inlet and Gippsland Lakes.  ",1
7187,"Similarly in South Australia, it is most abundant along the north coast of Kangaroo ",0
7188,"The range extends to the islands of Bass Strait and Tasmania, and it is thought able to move between the islands and the mainland.  ",1
7189,There is one unconfirmed record from Lord Howe Island and several from New Zealand.  ,1
7190,"They are a common sight in coastal areas, but may also be seen well inland (It is reportedly seen at the Panna Tiger Reserve in central India, nearly 1,000 km (621 mi) away from the sea shore)   ",1
7191,"The white-bellied sea eagle is generally sedentary and territorial, although it may travel long distances. ",0
7192,They have been reported travelling upriver to hunt for flying foxes (Pteropus). ,0
7193,Populations in inland Australia move around as inland bodies of water appear and then dry up.  ,1
7194,"In one instance, a pair came to breed at Lake Albacutya in northwestern Victoria after the lake had been empty for 30 years.  ",1
7195,"The species is easily disturbed by humans, especially when nesting, and may desert nesting sites as a result. ",0
7196,It is found in greater numbers in areas with little or no human impact or interference.  ,1
7197,"The white-bellied sea eagle is generally territorial; some birds form permanent pairs that inhabit territories throughout the year, while others are nomadic. ",0
7198,"The species is monogamous, with pairs remaining together until one bird dies, after which the surviving bird quickly seeks a new mate. ",0
7199,This can lead to some nest sites being continuously occupied for many years (one site in Mallacoota was occupied for over fifty years).  ,1
7200,"Immature birds are generally dispersive, with many moving over 50 km (31 mi) away from the area they were raised. ",0
7201,"One juvenile raised in Cowell, South Australia was reported 3,000 km (1,900 mi) away at Fraser Island in Queensland.  ",1
7202,"A study of the species in Jervis Bay showed increases in the numbers of immature and subadult birds in autumn, although it was unclear whether these were locally fledged or (as was considered more likely) an influx of young birds born and raised elsewhere in Australia.  Birds are often seen perched high in a tree, or soaring over waterways and adjacent land. ",1
7203,"Small groups of white-bellied sea eagles sometimes gather if there is a plentiful source of food such as a carcass or fish offal on a ship.  Much of the white-bellied sea eagle's behaviour, particularly breeding, remains poorly known.  ",1
7204,"The breeding season varies according to locationâit has been recorded in the dry season in the Trans-Fly region and Central Province of Papua New Guinea,  and from June to August in Australia.  ",1
7205,"A pair of white-bellied sea eagles performs skilful displays of flying before copulation: diving, gliding and chasing each other while calling loudly. ",0
7206,"They may mirror each other, flying 2â3 m (6.6â9.8 ft) apart and copying each other swooping and swerving. ",0
7207,A talon-grappling display has been recorded where the pair will fly high before one flips upside down and tries to grapple the other's talons with its own. ,0
7208,"If successful, the two then plunge cartwheeling before separating as they approach the ground.   ",1
7209,This behaviour has also been recorded as an aggressive display against a wedge-tailed eagle.  ,1
7210,The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses tall trees or man-made pylons to nest in.  ,1
7211,"Often, locations are sought where there is a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which can be used as a perch to survey the surrounding area,  which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover.  ",1
7212,The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area.  ,1
7213,"The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. ",0
7214,Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water.  ,1
7215,Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used.  ,1
7216,"Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. ",0
7217,"A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs.  ",1
7218,"Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. ",0
7219,"The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. ",0
7220,"Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. ",0
7221,"Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). ",0
7222,"One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest.  ",1
7223,"If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood.  ",1
7224,"Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.  ",1
7225,"The white-bellied sea eagle is an opportunistic carnivore and consumes a wide variety of animal prey, including carrion.  ",1
7226,It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons.  ,1
7227,It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. ,0
7228,The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45-degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface.  ,1
7229,"While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.  ",1
7230,"The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes,  but it takes birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well.   ",1
7231,"In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been reported feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus.  ",1
7232,"It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up to the size of a swan. ",0
7233,"They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.   ",1
7234,"They harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers, whistling kites, brahminy kites and ospreys, forcing them to drop any food that they are carrying.   ",1
7235,"Other birds victimised include silver and Pacific gulls, cormorants and Australasian gannets. ",0
7236,There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. ,0
7237,"They may even steal food from their own species, including their mates. ",0
7238,"The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly.  ",1
7239,"Southern fur seals have also been targeted for their fish.  White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or in family groups. ",1
7240,Prey can be eaten while the bird is flying or when it lands on a raised platform such as its nest. ,0
7241,The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it.  ,1
7242,"It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.  ",1
7243,A 2006 study of inland bodies of water around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap in the range of prey taken. ,0
7244,"Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, terrestrial birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. ",0
7245,"White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. ",0
7246,Rabbits constituted only a small fraction of the white-bellied sea eagle's diet. ,0
7247,"Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores.  ",1
7248,"However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.  ",1
7249,The white-bellied sea eagle is listed as being of Least Concern by the IUCN.  ,1
7250,"There are an estimated 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals, although there seems to be a decline in numbers. ",0
7251,They have become rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia.  ,1
7252,"They are relatively abundant in Hong Kong, where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009.  ",1
7253,A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance (as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity) had lower breeding success rates.  ,1
7254,"In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles' territories.  ",1
7255,"Elsewhere, the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally, such as the removal of stands of Casuarina equisetifolia in Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh in India.  ",1
7256,"In India, nest densities of about one per 4.32 km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one per 3.57 km (45 nests along 161 km) in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.   ",1
7257,"They also nest on Netrani Island, where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 (then known as Pigeon Island) by Allan Octavian Hume who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species.  ",1
7258,"In 2000, the disturbance to the island from torpedo-firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat.  ",1

7261,A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. ,0
7262,"This average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. ",0
7263,"The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. ",0
7264,"DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.  ",1

7292,The white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) is a small songbird of the nuthatch family common across much of temperate North America. ,0
7293,"It is stocky, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. ",0
7294,"It has a black cap, white face, chest, and flanks, blue-gray upperparts, and a chestnut lower belly. ",0
7295,Its nine subspecies differ mainly in the color of the body plumage. ,0
7296,"Like other nuthatches, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on trunks and branches and is able to move head-first down trees. ",0
7297,"Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts stored in the fall. ",0
7298,"The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. ",0
7299,"Forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but there are no major conservation concerns over most of its range. ",0
7300,"The nuthatches are   a genus, Sitta, of small passerine birds which derive their English name from the propensity of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack at them with their strong bills.  Sitta is derived from sitteÌ, the Ancient Greek for nuthatch,  and carolinensis means ""of Carolina"" in Latin. ",1
7301,"The white-breasted nuthatch was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in his 1790 work, the Index Ornithologicus.  ",1
7302,"Nuthatch taxonomy is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. ",0
7303,"The white-breasted nuthatch has an appearance and contact call similar to those of the white-cheeked nuthatch, Sitta leucopsis, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it.  ",1
7304,"A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song.  ",1
7305,"A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant nuthatch (S. magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.  ",1
7306,"Like other members of its genus, the white-breasted nuthatch has a large head, short tail, short wings, a powerful bill and strong feet; it is 13â14 cm (5.1â5.5 in) long, with a wingspan of 20â27 cm (7.9â10.6 in) and a weight of 18â30 g (0.63â1.06 oz).  The adult male of the nominate subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), and a black band on the upper back. ",1
7307,"The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. ",0
7308,"The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.  ",1
7309,"The female has, on average, a narrower black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. ",0
7310,"Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably distinguished from the male in the field. ",0
7311,"In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40â80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles are similar to the adult, but duller plumaged.  ",1
7312,"Like other nuthatches, this is a noisy species with a range of vocalizations. ",0
7313,"The contact call between members of a pair, given most frequently in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. ",0
7314,"A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call,  and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.  ",1
7315,"Three other, significantly smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, but none has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. ",0
7316,"Further distinctions are that the red-breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.  ",1
7317,"The white-breasted nuthatch has nine subspecies, although the differences are small and change gradually across the range. ",0
7318,"The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. ",0
7319,"These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions.  ",1
7320,"The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern S. c. carolinensis has the palest back.  ",1
7321,The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. ,0
7322,"The Great Basin and Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, where they do not seem to mix. ",0
7323,"The breeding habitat of the white-breasted nuthatch is woodland across North America, from southern Canada to northern Florida and southern Mexico. ",0
7324,"In the eastern part of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open deciduous or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at 1,675 m (5,495 ft) altitude in Tennessee. ",0
7325,"In the west and Mexico, this nuthatch is found in open montane pine-oak woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to 3,200 m (10,500 ft) altitude in Nevada, California and Mexico.  ",1
7326,"The white-breasted nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; red-breasted, pygmy and brown-headed nuthatches prefer pines.  ",1
7327,"The presence of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, beech and hickory are favored in the east since they also provide edible seeds.  White-breasted nuthatches seldom notch out their own nest like Red-breasted nuthatches.  and although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is discontinuous. ",1
7328,The separate populations of this non-migratory species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.  ,1
7329,"This nuthatch, like most of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults normally stay in their territory year-round. ",0
7330,"There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years,  and this species has occurred as a vagrant to Vancouver Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Bermuda. ",1
7331,One bird landed on the RMS Queen Mary six hours' sailing east of New York City in October 1963.  ,1
7332,"The white-breasted nuthatch is monogamous, and pairs form following a courtship in which the male bows to the female, spreading his tail and drooping his wings while swaying back and forth; he also feeds her morsels of food.  ",1
7333,"The pair establish a territory of 0.1â0.15 km2 (25â37 acres) in woodland, and up to 0.2 km2 (49 acres) in semi-wooded habitats, and then remain together year-round until one partner dies or disappears.  ",1
7334,"The nest cavity is usually a natural hole in a decaying tree, sometimes an old woodpecker nest.  ",1
7335,"The nest hole is usually 3â12 m (9.8â39.4 ft) high in a tree and is lined with fur, fine grass, and shredded bark. ",0
7336,"The clutch is 5 to 9 eggs which are creamy-white, speckled with reddish brown, and average 19 mm Ã 14 mm (0.75 in Ã 0.55 in) in size. ",0
7337,"The eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14 days prior to hatching, and the altricial chicks fledge in a further 18 to 26 days.  Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and for about two weeks after fledging, and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating. ",1
7338,"Once independent, juveniles leave the adults' territory and either establish their own territory or become ""floaters"", unpaired birds without territories. ",0
7339,It is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species. ,0
7340,This species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding and has the unusual habit of removing its feces from the roost site in the morning. ,0
7341,"It usually roosts alone except in very cold weather, when up to 29 birds have been recorded together.  Predators of adult nuthatches include owls and diurnal birds of prey (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and climbing snakes such as the western rat snake. ",1
7342,The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. ,0
7343,"When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell.  ",1
7344,"The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.  ",1
7345,"The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years,  but the record is twelve years and nine months.  ",1
7346,This nuthatch's responses to predators may be linked to a reproductive strategy. ,0
7347,A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. ,0
7348,"The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs.  ",1
7349,"The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. ",0
7350,"This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.  ",1
7351,"The white-breasted nuthatch forages along tree trunks and branches in a similar way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. ",0
7352,All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.   ,1
7353,"It places large food items such as acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees.  ",1
7354,"The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. ",0
7355,"The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, oystershell and other scale insects, and jumping plant lice.    ",1
7356,"This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store.  ",1
7357,The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines in order to find seeds.  The white-breasted nuthatch often travels with small mixed flocks in winter. ,1
7358,"These flocks are led by titmice and chickadees, with nuthatches and downy woodpeckers as common attendant species. ",0
7359,Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. ,0
7360,It is likely that the attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees' calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.  ,1
7361,"The white-breasted nuthatch is a common species with a large range, estimated at 8,600,000 km2 (3,300,000 sq mi). ",0
7362,"Its total population is estimated at 10 million individuals, and there is evidence of an overall population increase, so it is not believed to approach either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. ",0
7363,"The removal of dead trees from forests may cause problems locally for this species because it requires cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. ",0
7364,"In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest.    ",1
7365,"This nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.[14 ",0
7366,"The white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae) is a passerine bird, one of only two members of the river martin subfamily of the swallows. ",0
7367,"Since it has significant differences from its closest relative, the African river martin, it is sometimes placed in its own genus, Eurochelidon. ",0
7368,"First found in 1968, it is known only from a single wintering site in Thailand, and may be extinct, since it has not been seen since 1980 despite targeted surveys in Thailand and neighbouring Cambodia. ",0
7369,"It may possibly still breed in China or Southeast Asia, but a Chinese painting initially thought to depict this species was later reassessed as showing pratincoles. ",0
7370,"The adult white-eyed river martin is a medium-sized swallow, with mainly glossy greenish-black plumage, a white rump, and a tail which has two elongated slender central tail feathers, each widening to a racket-shape at the tip. ",0
7371,"It has a white eye ring and a broad, bright greenish-yellow bill. ",0
7372,"The sexes are similar in appearance, but the juvenile lacks the tail ornaments and is generally browner than the adult. ",0
7373,"Little is known of the behaviour or breeding habitat of this martin, although like other swallows it feeds on insects caught in flight, and its wide bill suggests that it may take relatively large species. ",0
7374,"It roosts in reed beds in winter, and may nest in river sandbanks, probably in April or May before the summer rains. ",0
7375,It may have been overlooked prior to its discovery because it tended to feed at dawn or dusk rather than during the day. ,0
7376,"The martin's apparent demise may have been hastened by trapping, loss of habitat and the construction of dams. ",0
7377,"The winter swallow roosts at the only known location of this martin have greatly reduced in numbers, and birds using river habitats for breeding have declined throughout the region. ",0
7378,"The white-eyed river martin is one of only two birds endemic to Thailand, and the country's government has noted this through the issues of a stamp and a high-value commemorative coin. ",0
7379,"Within the swallow family, the white-eyed river martin is one of only two members of the river martin subfamily ",0
7380,"Pseudochelidoninae, the other being the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina of the Congo basin in Africa. ",0
7381,"These two species possess a number of distinctive features which mark them out from other swallows and martins, including their robust legs and feet, and stout bills.  ",1
7382,The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of the two martins suggest that they are relict populations of a group of species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolution.  ,1
7383,"The separation of this subfamily is supported by genetic evidence,  and their habit of nesting in burrows is thought to be characteristic of the earliest members of the swallow family.  The white-eyed river martin was discovered in 1968 by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya, who gave the bird its current binomial name.   ",1
7384,"The genus name Pseudochelidon (Hartlaub, 1861) comes from the Ancient Greek prefix ÏÎμÏÎ ́Î¿/pseudo ""false"" and ÏÎμÎ»Î1Î ́Î¿Î1⁄2/chelidoÌn, ""swallow"",  and the species name sirintarae commemorates Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand.  ",1
7385,"The African and Asian Pseudochelidon species differ markedly in the size of their bills and eyes, suggesting that they have different feeding ecologies, with the white-eyed river martin probably able to take much larger prey. ",0
7386,"The Thai species also has a swollen, hard gape (fleshy interior of the bill) unlike the softer, fleshier, and much less prominent gape of the African river martin.  ",1
7387,"Thonglongya estimated the bill of the Thai species to be 17.6% wider than that of the African bird, but a later estimate, using specimens preserved in alcohol instead of dried skins (to avoid shrinkage), gave a difference of 22.5% between the bills of the two swallows.  Following a suggestion by Kitti in his original paper,  ",1
7388,"Richard Brooke proposed in 1972 that the white-eyed river martin was sufficiently different from the African species to be placed in a separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon,  but this was contested by other authorities.    ",1
7389,"The new genus was not subsequently widely adopted by other authors,    although BirdLife International uses Eurochelidon.  ",1
7390,"The adult white-eyed river martin is a medium-sized swallow, 18 cm (7 in) long, with mainly silky black plumage and a white rump. ",0
7391,"The back is green-glossed black, and is separated from the similarly coloured upper tail by a narrow bright white rump band. ",0
7392,"The head is darker than the back, with a velvet-black chin leading to blue-green glossed black underparts. ",0
7393,"The wings are black, with brown inner edges to the flight feathers,  and the tail is green-glossed black with two elongated, slender, central tail feathers, up to 9 cm (3.5 in) long.  ",1
7394,These expand slightly at the tips to give narrow racquets 4.9â8.5 cm (1.9â3.3 in) long. ,0
7395,"The wing length averages 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the tail is 10.7 cm (4.2 in) long, and the tarsus averages 1.1 cm (0.43 in).  ",1
7396,"The iris and eyelid are white, giving the appearance of a white eye ring, and the broad, bright greenish-yellow bill has a black hooked tip to the upper mandible. ",0
7397,"This species is silent when wintering, and its breeding vocalisations are unknown.  ",1
7398,"The sexes are similar, but the juvenile lacks the tail racquets, has a brown head and chin, and is generally browner than the adult. ",0
7399,Juveniles taken in January and February were moulting their body feathers.  ,1
7400,"The original Thai name for the Pseudochelidon, only known to local people in Bueng Boraphet, was à ̧à ̧à ̧à ̧2à ̧à ̧­à ̧ ",0

7403,"The white-eyed river martin was discovered in 1968 by Kitti Thonglongya,  who obtained nine specimens netted by professional bird-hunters as part of a migratory bird survey at a night-time roost at Thailand's largest freshwater lake, Bueng Boraphet in Nakhon Sawan Province.  ",1
7404,It was first seen in the wild by ornithologists at the same wintering site in 1977.  ,1
7405,"The species has only been seen at the lake, always between the months of November and February, and the wintering habitat is assumed to be in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed beds for the night-time roost.  ",1
7406,"The white-eyed river martin may be migratory, and if the breeding habitat resembles that of the African river martin, it is likely to be the forested valleys of large rivers; these can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey.  ",1
7407,"The breeding grounds and habitat are unknown, although river valleys in northern Thailand or southwestern China are possibilities.  ",1
7408,A claimed depiction of this species in a Chinese scroll painting initially appeared to support the possibility of the martin breeding in China. ,0
7409,"The bird in the painting had a similarly shaped head and bill, a white eye and a long tail, although it lacked the white rump, did not show the correct bill colour, and elongated the outer, rather than central, tail feathers. ",0
7410,"Painted before 1970, it pre-dated the publication of pictures of the Thai bird, so it must have been painted from life.  ",1
7411,It is now thought more likely that the scroll shows Oriental pratincoles ,0
7412,"(Glareola maldivarum).   Cambodia and Burma have also been suggested as possible refuges for the martin,  but there has also been speculation on whether it is migratory at all.  Since its breeding grounds are undiscovered, nothing is known about the white-eyed river martin's breeding biology, although it is suggested that it may nest in burrows in river sandbars,  probably in April or May before the monsoon rain raises water levels.  ",1
7413,"However, distinct differences in foot and toe morphology from its African relative have led some authorities to speculate that even the assumption that it nests in burrows could be incorrect.  ",1
7414,"Like other swallows, the white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing.  Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may well take larger insects than other swallows.  ",1
7415,"This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches,  behaviour that, together with its unusual toe-shape and the fact that mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggest that this species may be relatively terrestrial.  ",1
7416,"Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or at least crepuscular, a factor that could make it very inconspicuous, and thus partly explain how it remained undetected for so long. ",0
7417,"Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reedbeds might appear to contradict this theory, it is possible that the birds might not have been caught at the roost. ",0
7418,"Alternatively, they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, or be crepuscular, depending on the season or circumstance.  ",1
7419,"The white-eyed river martin was seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not definitely since,  although there is an unconfirmed sighting from Thailand from 1986.  ",1
7420,"It is classified as Critically Endangered, which is the highest risk category assigned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) for wild species. ",0
7421,"The designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. ",0
7422,"The IUCN does not consider a species extinct until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted, but the white-eyed river martin may well no longer exist in the wild,  and was probably always rare.  ",1
7423,"There has been a drastic decline in the Bueng Boraphet swallow population from the hundreds of thousands reported to roost around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980â1981, although it is not certain if this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to hunting.  ",1
7424,"Other potential causes for the martin's decline include the disturbance of sand bars in the rivers, and the construction of dams (which flood the area upstream and change the water flow downstream), deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture.  Other Southeast Asian species using riverine sand bars have also been adversely affected by disturbance and habitat degradation.  ",1
7425,"Very few swallows of any kind now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts.  ",1
7426,"The martin is legally protected under Appendix 1 (the highest category) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement,  and is one of 15 ""Reserved Species"" in Thailand which, under the provisions of the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act, BE 2535, cannot be legally hunted, collected, or kept in captivity under any circumstances.   Despite official protection, the martin was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists, and following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers were reported to have caught as many as 120 individuals and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity.  ",1
7427,Two birds sent to Bangkok Zoo in 1971 also soon died.  ,1
7428,"The small population may therefore have become non-viable.  Bueng Boraphet has been declared a Non-Hunting Area in an effort to protect the species,  but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. ",1
7429,"These include several searches at the main site, a 1969 survey of the Nan, Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos.  ",1
7430,"A possible sighting was made in Cambodia in 2004,  but a 2008 investigation using speedboat surveys and interviews with villagers in Cambodia near the location of the claimed sighting failed to find any positive evidence, and noted that the habitat was in poor condition.  ",1
7431,"Nevertheless, animals as a large as the saola have been rediscovered in Southeast Asia, so it is conceivable that a small population of the martin survives.  ",1
7432,"Despite the lack of records from China, a 2000 field guide covering the region included this species, since it is the mostly likely breeding area outside Thailand,  although it is omitted from the 2008 Birds of East Asia.  ",1
7433,"The white-eyed river martin and the Deignan's babbler, Stachyridopsis rodolphei,  are the only bird species endemic to Thailand,  and the martin has attracted sufficient interest to be featured on a 75 satang postage stamp in 1975, as one of a set of four depicting Thai birds,  and on a 5,000 Thai baht conservation issue gold coin in 1974.[36 ",1
7434,"The white-naped xenopsaris  (Xenopsaris albinucha), also known as the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, the only member of the genus Xenopsaris. ",1
7435,"It is found in South America, in humid subtropical and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: ",0
7436,"Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. ",0
7437,"The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae. ",0
7438,"The bird is 12.5 to 13 cm (4.9â5.1 in) in length, with whitish undersides, a black crown, and grey-brown upperparts. ",0
7439,"The sexes are similar in appearance, though the females have duller upperparts. ",0
7440,"It feeds on insects in the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes on the ground. ",0
7441,Nesting occurs in a simple cup nest placed in the fork of a tree. ,0
7442,"When the chicks fledge, the parents may divide up the brood to continue helping. ",0
7443,"The species is not common and little is known about it, but it is not considered in danger of extinction, and has been classified as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ",0
7444,"The white-naped xenopsaris was described in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. ",0
7445,"It was moved to the monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. ",0
7446,"A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris,  but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.  ",1
7447,Which family the species belonged to remained unresolved for over a century. ,0
7448,"According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Xenopsaris and its allies were ""taxonomically problematic genera that have for more than a hundred years been shifted back and forth between the cotingas (Cotingidae) and the Tyrannidae"".  ",1
7449,"When placed with the tyrant-flycatchers, Tyrannidae, it was considered closely related to the genera Suiriri, Serpophaga and Knipolegus. ",0
7450,"The uncertainty was not confined to this species, as there was a general confusion about where to draw the lines between the cotingas, tyrant-flycatchers and manakins.  Resolution was provided by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. ",1
7451,"In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae.  ",1
7452,This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society.  ,1
7453,"A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. ",0
7454,"These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are needed to understand the complete relationship between these four genera.  ",1
7455,"The genus name Xenopsaris was derived from the Ancient Greek word xeno, meaning ""stranger"", and Psaris,  a synonym for Tiyra, based on the Ancient Greek for starling,  described by Georges Cuvier in 1817.  ",1
7456,The specific name albinucha is from Latin and refers to the bird's white (albus) nape (nuchus).  ,1
7457,"The species is also known as the reed becard,  white-naped becard  and simply xenopsaris.  ",1
7458,"There are two subspecies of white-naped xenopsaris; the widespread nominate subspecies, and the more restricted X. a. minor of Venezuela, which was described by Carl Eduard Hellmayr in 1920.  ",1
7459,"The white-naped xenopsaris is smaller than the closely related becards and tityras, measuring 12.5 to 13 cm (4.9â5.1 in) in length and weighing around 10 g (0.35 oz). ",0
7460,"The subspecies X. a. minor has the same plumage as the nominate subspecies, but is smaller; the wing-chord (measurement from the wrist-joint to the end of the wing) length of the nominate subspecies, for example, is 6.4 to 6.6 cm (2.5â2.6 in) compared to 6.0 to 6.2 cm (2.4â2.4 in) in X. a. minor.  ",1
7461,"The face, lores, throat, breast, belly and rump of this species are white; the undersides are tinged with grey on the chest and yellow on the belly. ",0
7462,The nape is pale grey with a grey-white to white band separating the crown from the back. ,0
7463,The wings are dusky greyish brown with white edging on the inner remiges and wing-coverts. ,0
7464,"The tail is dusky brown, and the stout bill, iris and legs are black. ",0
7465,"The female is similar to the male, but is duller overall and has a chestnut-tinged crown. ",0
7466,"Juvenile birds resemble adults but have greyish napes and more chestnut in the crown,  and the feathers of the back, rump and primaries are scalloped with ochre. ",1
7467,"The secondaries on the wing and the tail feathers are edged with white.[11The song of this species is delicate, and does not carry far. ",0
7468,"It is most commonly heard during the rainy season, but can be heard at any time of the day. ",0
7469,"The call is described as a thin, high-pitched and hesitant ""teep, tre'e'e'e'e'a eea wu'u'u'e'e'e-e-e-e-e-p"" or a ""twip, tsiweeeÌ, tseee, ti-ti-ti-ti"", according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World. ",0
7470,"The initial trill is described as rising and then falling, and the last trill is described as long. ",0
7471,Birds may sometimes vary the pattern and only use part of the song. ,0
7472,"The species is also described as making a squeaky and undulating screech,  and males are described as whistling on the nest.  ",1
7473,"Foraging males have been observed making an ascending ""shreee"" every few seconds while hunting for insects.  ",1
7474,"The white-naped xenopsaris looks somewhat similar to the cinereous becard, which overlaps its range in Venezuela. ",0
7475,"The white-naped xenopsaris is smaller, with a longer tail, thinner bill, whiter underparts (instead of grey) and browner upperparts (rather than greyish) .  ",1
7476,"The southern population of the nominate subspecies is widespread from north-eastern Brazil through to Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina and Uruguay. ",0
7477,"The subspecies X. a. minor is found in west and central Venezuela, and probably extends into north-eastern Colombia.  ",1
7478,"The species is generally resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds have suggested that the species may be migratory in Bolivia  and Brazil.  ",1
7479,"A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September ",0
7480,"In 2006 the species was reported for the first time in Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.  ",1
7481,"They occupy a variety of habitats across their range, including Caatinga scrubland, riparian (river) woodland, lightly wooded areas, the borders of open gallery forest and open areas with scattered trees. ",0
7482,"They usually live near water or damp areas, and range from sea-level to 550 m (1,800 ft).  ",1
7483,"The white-naped xenopsaris feeds on insects, but no studies have yet been done on the diet of adults. ",0
7484,"Chicks in the nest are fed grasshoppers from the family Acrididae, mantidflies, praying mantises and mosquitoes.  ",1
7485,"Adults typically hunt singly or sometimes in pairs, and breeding pairs can often be observed hunting well apart from each other. ",0
7486,"They typically hunt from a perch on the outer edge of the foliage of trees, watching for prey and then launching themselves 0.5 to 1.5 m (1.6â4.9 ft) to snatch prey off leaves. ",0
7487,"They also strike from a hovering position above foliage, and may chase prey acrobatically for some distance. ",0
7488,They often feed near the ground and sometimes take prey from the ground as well as from vegetation.  ,1
7489,"Nesting timing varies by location; in Venezuela it is reported to occur during the rainy season (June to September),  and in Argentina during the austral summer (October to January). ",1
7490,"The nests are cup-shaped, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) across, 4 cm (1.6 in) high and 1.8 cm (0.71 in) deep. ",0
7491,"Nests have been recorded being constructed from fine dry grass,  or woven plant fibre and a few rootlets.[2 ",1
7492,] Nests are placed in the forks of branches 4 to 15 m ,0
7493,(13â49 ft) up in trees 15 to 20 m (49â66 ft) tall.   ,1
7494,"The clutch size is three eggs, which are greenish with brown spots. ",0
7495,Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 14â15 day brooding period. ,0
7496,"The species has been described as very tame during this interval â staying on the nest even as researchers came within a few centimetres of the bird â but were very aggressive in attacking birds, like guira cuckoos, or other animals that came near the nest. ",0
7497,Pink mouths in chicks are very unusual in suboscines.  Chicks hatch within 24 hours of each other. ,1
7498,"Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they are covered in whitish down. ",0
7499,Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail to the side of the nest ,0
7500,", so nests with older chicks are surrounded by faecal matter. ",0
7501,"Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. ",0
7502,"When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.  ",1
7503,The chicks are fed by the parents for several days after fledging. ,0
7504,"The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.  ",1
7505,"Across its range, the white-naped xenopsaris is uncommon and patchily distributed.   ",1
7506,"It has not been evaluated as threatened by the IUCN Red List, as it does not meet any of the criteria. ",0
7507,"The population is evaluated as being stable, as there is no evidence of any decline or extreme fluctuations. ",0
7508,"It also occupies an enormous range, estimated to be 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi). ",0
7509,"For these reasons, it is evaluated as a species of least concern.[1The white-necked rockfowl (Picathartes gymnocephalus) is a medium-sized bird in the family Picathartidae, with a long neck and tail. ",0
7510,"Also known as the white-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky forested areas at higher altitudes in West Africa from Guinea to Ghana. ",0
7511,"Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. ",0
7512,"It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the grey-necked rockfowl. ",0
7513,"Its unusually long, dark brown tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. ",0
7514,"The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being bright yellow except for two large, circular black patches located just behind the eyes. ",0
7515,"These rockfowl feed primarily on insects, though parents feed small frogs to their young. ",0
7516,"One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus army ant swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. ",0
7517,Rockfowl move through the forest primarily through a series of hops and bounds or short flights in low vegetation. ,0
7518,"The white-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies with as many as eight nests. ",0
7519,"These nests are constructed out of mud formed into a deep cup and are built on rock surfaces, typically in caves. ",0
7520,"Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide is fairly common in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. ",0
7521,This species is classified as Vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. ,0
7522,"Conservation efforts are underway in parts of its range in the form of habitat protection, education efforts, and new laws. ",0
7523,Some of the indigenous peoples of Sierra Leone considered the species to be a protector of the home of their ancestral spirits. ,0
7524,This rockfowl is considered one of Africa's most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range. ,0
7525,This species was first described by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1825 from a specimen collected on the Guinean coast.  ,1
7526,"He published his description in the 2nd volume of Nouveau recueil de planches colorieÌes d'oiseaux and described it as Corvus gymnocephalus, placing it in the crow genus Corvus.  ",1
7527,"The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words gymnos ""naked"", and kephaleÌ ""head"".  ",1
7528,"However, only three years later the bird was removed from the genus Corvus by ReneÌ PrimeveÌre Lesson and placed in its own genus, Picathartes, as it did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head.  ",1
7529,"This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for ""magpie"" and cathartes for ""vulture"".   ",1
7530,"Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae).  Today the white-necked rockfowl and its close relative the grey-necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae.  ",1
7531,It has also been suggested though not generally accepted that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order.  ,1
7532,"Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and southeast Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade. ",0
7533,The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44 million years ago.  ,1
7534,It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa.  ,1
7535,"Though the white-necked rockfowl has no subspecies, it is believed to form a superspecies with the grey-necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial pattern being the primary differences between the two species.  ",1
7536,"Common names used for this species include white-necked rockfowl, white-necked picathartes, yellow-headed picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, and the less frequently used white-necked bald crow. ",0
7537,Rockfowl is a reference to the species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves.  ,1
7538,"Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head and somewhat crow-like appearance, especially its beak.  ",1
7539,"This rockfowl measures around 38 to 41 cm (15 to 16 in) in length, with its notably long tail contributing about 18 cm (7.1 in).  ",1
7540,Adult rockfowl show little sexual dimorphism in plumage and the sexes cannot be told apart by appearance.  ,1
7541,"On the adult, the head, excluding the chin and throat, is completely bare of feathers except for a thin layer of fuzz on the forehead.  ",1
7542,"The head's skin is bright yellow except for two large, circular patches of black skin located just behind the eye and containing the ear; only a thin, 2 mm (0.079 in) wide patch of yellow skin on the crown prevents the two black patches from connecting.  ",1
7543,The black patch has a raised edge and appears to be a distinct part of the face.  ,1
7544,"The eyelid and eyering are a thin line of black surrounding the bird's large, dark brown eyes.  ",1
7545,"This beak can be considered crow-like, is noticeably decurved in the upper mandible, and is about 30 mm (1.2 in) long.   ",1
7546,"The bird's chin and throat are covered in a thin layer of white feathers, and the neck is long and slender.   ",1
7547,"The nape is also covered in white feathers, while the hindneck is nearly bare, revealing the orange-yellow skin. ",0
7548,"The upper mantle is a solid black, merging into a greyish-black lower mantle.  ",1
7549,The rockfowl's thighs are very muscular and aid its partially terrestrial lifestyle.  ,1
7550,"The back, rump, and undertail are a bluish grey, while the tail is a dark brown and tented in shape. ",0
7551,The underparts are a creamy white and appear their creamiest in the upper breast.  ,1
7552,In dim light the white-necked rockfowl can appear to be solely black above and white below.  ,1
7553,The adult weighs 200 to 250 g (7.1 to 8.8 oz).  ,1
7554,"The nestling is born naked with dark-brown skin above and translucent pink skin below, blind, and with an orange-red gape.   ",1
7555,"After a few days, the gape changes to a bright yellow-orange. ",0
7556,"After hatching, the head's skin is all yellow without the black patches of the adult; these are gained about a week before leaving the nest. ",0
7557,"An immature rockfowl after its fourth week is very similar to the adult, but its underparts are creamier and silkier than those of the adult, its neck possesses fewer feathers, and the yellow on the head is paler.  ",1
7558,"Most noticeably, its tail is significantly shorter than that of the adult.  ",1
7559,"Although numerous calls have been recorded, the white-necked rockfowl is normally a silent bird. ",0
7560,"Its call has been compared to the clucks of a chicken, with clucks of ""chuk-chuk-chuk"" or ""choop-choop-choop"" being made at a constant rate of eight notes every five seconds.  ",1
7561,"It has been suggested that this call may be a proper song, but more research is required to determine if this is accurate.  ",1
7562,"The rockfowl's alarm call, one of its more frequent sounds, has been described as a continuous, low-pitched, guttural chatter similar to ""ow, ow, ow"".  ",1
7563,"Adults and juveniles have also been known to produce a long-drawn ""owooh"" call note.  ",1
7564,"Additionally, fledglings can give a loud, quavering second-long whistle as a contact call.  ",1
7565,This species is only found in West Africa from Guinea to Ghana.  ,1
7566,"It is locally common in southeastern Guinea, and is widespread in Sierra Leone except for the north and northwest, and in Liberia except for the north and northeast.  ",1
7567,In CoÌte d'Ivoire the species is currently restricted to areas near the Guinean and Liberian border.  ,1
7568,"The bird also lives in Ghana, where it is both local and uncommon in the south central parts of the nation.  ",1
7569,"The white-necked rockfowl's total range covers approximately 391,000 km2 (151,000 sq mi).  ",1
7570,"However, the species occurs in low population densities in patches across this large range.  ",1
7571,"The species does not migrate, though it does disperse widely after the breeding season.  ",1
7572,This rockfowl lives on steep slopes in both primary and mature secondary forests. ,0
7573,"These forests are typically covered in rocks and are found in hilly lowland areas up to 800 m (2,600 ft).  ",1
7574,The white-necked rockfowl often lives near flowing streams and rivers so that it has access to wet mud for nest construction.  Colonies are typically found within 100 m (330 ft) of a stream.  ,1
7575,"The species also seems to show a preference for living near inselbergs.  Rockfowl are occasionally seen in partly cleared forests and near cities, but this appears to be abnormal.  ",1
7576,Recent surveys have shown that abandoned rockfowl nests are more likely to be in or near secondary forest.  ,1
7577,This picathartes typically keeps low in the vegetation or on the ground near its nesting grounds. ,0
7578,"It moves quickly through its forested habitat primarily through a series of hops and bounds, followed by a pause before resuming its movements. ",0
7579,"The rockfowl also flies at a low altitude for short distances between vines and trees, and it rarely flies for long distances.  ",1
7580,This species can disappear from sight into a mass of creepers or rocks. ,0
7581,"It is capable of high jumps, sometimes jumping 6 m (20 ft) off the cave floor to its nest while only partly using its wings.  ",1
7582,"It was once thought that the rockfowl rarely ventures far from its breeding grounds; however, new data suggests that the species has a much broader range than previously thought.[20 ",0
7583,] Rockfowl have been known to continue roosting on their nests for a period following the breeding season.  ,1
7584,"These birds are normally solitary or in pairs, though sometimes they live in groups of three to five birds.  ",1
7585,"However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers.  ",1
7586,One of the rockfowl's displays entails several of the birds in a colony forming a loose circle. ,0
7587,"Individual rockfowl run at each other, forcing the approached bird to retreat slightly before chasing either the bird that charged it or another in the circle. ",0
7588,"At intervals during this display a rockfowl leans forward on a branch, tucking its head between its legs and half-spreading its wings, thus revealing its crown to the other rockfowl. ",0
7589,"It is believed that this behavior shows the intent of the rockfowl to roost in a group, though recent evidence suggests that the display could be involved in breeding.  ",1
7590,"To scratch its head, the bird lifts its foot over its wing.  ",1
7591,"The white-necked rockfowl forages across slopes on mossy, creeper-covered boulders and in trees covered in lianas and hanging mosses.  ",1
7592,"It occasionally forages by hopping across sand by a stream or even in the stream, as evidenced by crab remains in the rockfowl's droppings.   ",1
7593,"While foraging on the ground, the rockfowl picks up leaves with its bill and tosses them aside.  ",1
7594,"It feeds in mixed-species groups ahead of swarms of Dorylus ants with alethes, bristlebills, and Finsch's rufous thrushes, picking off insects flushed by the ants, mostly off the ground.  ",1
7595,The rockfowl has also been observed hopping from the ground and snatching prey midair.  ,1
7596,"The diet is diverse and generalized, enabling the white-necked rockfowl to have a degree of adaptability in collecting food.  ",1
7597,"This rockfowl primarily eats insects, including larval cockroaches, tettigoniid grasshoppers, earwigs, ants from the genera Pachycondyla and Dorylus, click beetles from the genus Psephus, and termites.  ",1
7598,"Other than insects, it has been observed eating millipedes, centipedes, snails, earthworms, and occasionally small frogs and lizards.  ",1
7599,"When feeding its nestlings, the rockfowl primarily collects earthworms, small frogs, and lizards, with the vertebrates forming most of the biomass fed to the young.  ",1
7600,"In addition, rockfowl are occasionally seen eating plant material, normally from angiosperms or mosses.  ",1
7601,The White-necked rockfowl breeds primarily in caves and pairs nest either alone or as part of a small colony.  ,1
7602,"While its courtship behavior is unknown, the species is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate despite earlier suggestions that it bred cooperatively.   ",1
7603,"The White-necked rockfowl has two breeding seasons throughout the year, though the timing of the breeding seasons is determined by the location of the birds and the timing of the wet season, with nesting occurring just before and after the wet season and averaging 127 days apart.  ",1
7604,"The rockfowl reuses its nest, and typically repairs it two to eight weeks prior to laying eggs.  ",1
7605,"Guinean birds breed from July to January, while those in Sierra Leone breed from November to February and from April to October.  ",1
7606,"In Liberia, breeding occurs from September to December and from March to July.  ",1
7607,Ghana's rockfowl breed from March to June and September to November.  ,1
7608,"Breeding caves are traditionally deserted while the rockfowl are not breeding, so increased usage by the rockfowl is considered a first sign of breeding.  ",1
7609,"Nesting colonies average two to five nests, although one colony had forty nests.  ",1
7610,These birds occasionally attempt infanticide to gain access to prime nesting sites or mates.[21 ,0
7611,"] Birds in these colonies often chase each other in circles, even through the treetops, a rare destination for this species.  ",1
7612,"Unusually for a rainforest-dwelling bird, the white-necked rockfowl builds a nest out of mud with varying amounts of plant fibers mixed in.  ",1
7613,"Mud is collected from nearby rivers and streams and is shaped into a strong, thick-walled, and deep cup attached to the cave wall or roof, a cliff, or a large boulder approximately 2 to 4 m (6.6 to 13.1 ft) above the ground.   ",1
7614,These rocks must be sloped inwards to provide the nest with protection from the rain.  Phloem fibers and roots from plants line the inside of the cup. ,1
7615,"The white-necked rockfowl's nesting caves normally are populated by wasps, and the wasp nests 2-to-3 cm (0.79-to-1.18 in) long are often found embedded in the rockfowl's nests. ",0
7616,"It is believed that in order to build their nest on the smooth cave walls, rockfowl use the nests of the wasps as a nucleus to build around. ",0
7617,Cliff nests are always built at a distance from nearby plants.  ,1
7618,"Both birds work on the construction of the nest, with roles alternating as one bird collects the materials while the other shapes them into the nest. ",0
7619,"While nearly all rockfowl nests are found in caves or on cliffs, there are records of nesting occurring on a riverbank and on a fallen tree trunk.  ",1
7620,"Nests are typically constructed at least 1 m (3.3 ft) apart, but one colony had six nests adjoining each other.  ",1
7621,"Nests also vary widely in size, though they average to be 108 mm (4.3 in) long, 172 mm (6.8 in) wide, and 129 mm (5.1 in) deep.  ",1
7622,"It used to be believed that each pair builds two nests, one for breeding and one for roosting; however, recent surveys have found no evidence of this, with all nests in the colony being used for breeding.  One to two eggs, typically two, are laid in each nest a day or two apart.  ",1
7623,The eggs weigh about 14.5 g (0.51 oz) and have an average size of 25.8 by 38.3 mm (1.02 by 1.51 in).  ,1
7624,The eggs are a creamy white with dark brown blotches spread across the egg but in higher density near the larger end. ,0
7625,"Incubation, which begins after the first egg is laid, lasts for 23 to 28 days.  ",1
7626,The parents take turns incubating their eggs.  Hatching typically takes at least 12 hours.  ,1
7627,"The infant rockfowl's eyes open after nine to eleven days, while feathers begin to grow seven days after hatching.  ",1
7628,"After the young hatch, food is brought to them almost four times an hour. ",0
7629,"To feed its young, the adult rockfowl clings to the side of its nest while fluttering its wings; some birds use their tails as a prop underneath the nest to help support themselves.[17 ",0
7630,"] Rockfowl have been known to kill the young of other rockfowl, while nest predation is carried out by cobras of the genus Naja, the Nile monitor, sun squirrels, red-chested goshawks, and Procolobus monkeys.  ",1
7631,This leads on average to only 0.44 nestlings surviving per pair of rockfowl.  ,1
7632,"Due to potential infanticide by other rockfowl, parents protect their nest and vicious fights often occur.[20 ",0
7633,"] Rare among other bird species, this behaviour is prevalent in white-necked rockfowl. ",0
7634,"Not fully understood, it is thought to occur for the sake of resource competition or sexual selection.  ",1
7635,"The young leave the nest after 23 to 27 days, at which time they resemble the adult rockfowl but with much shorter tails.  ",1
7636,"The young leave the nest by standing on the edge, emitting a piercing whistle, and then gliding down to the ground on spread wings where they are met by an adult bearing insects.  ",1
7637,"Even after leaving the nest, the young return to roost on it with their parents.  ",1
7638,"In the lore of Sierra Leone's indigenous people, the often bizarre rock formations near which the white-necked rockfowl lives were believed to house ancestral spirits.  ",1
7639,"Its residence there led it to be considered a guardian of the formations, leading to a degree of residual respect for the species that persists despite the beliefs that spawned this respect being practically extinct.  ",1
7640,"However, in some regions the rockfowl's secretive habits and inaccessible habitat have meant it was unknown to the local population.  ",1
7641,Due to this species' uniqueness it became a symbol for ecotourism and rainforest conservation in the region in the 1990s.  ,1
7642,The white-necked rockfowl has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Ghana and Sierra Leone.  ,1
7643,"Due to its strange appearance and behavior and the difficulty in seeing the species, this bird is considered particularly fascinating by birdwatchers.    ",1
7644,This species is considered to be one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.  ,1
7645,"This species also helped launch Sir David Attenborough's career in 1954, when he was the producer on the new television program Zoo Quest. ",0
7646,"The show's presenter Jack Lester was required to travel to Africa to record attempts to capture animals for display in zoos, with the focus of the series being on the white-necked rockfowl. ",0
7647,"However, when he fell ill, Attenborough took his place, which launched him into the limelight and starting his narrating career.   ",1
7648,"This species is considered Vulnerable by the IUCN due to its highly fragmented distribution, dwindling population, and habitat destruction.  ",1
7649,It is considered to be less common and more threatened than the closely related grey-necked rockfowl.  ,1
7650,"The stronghold of the species is in Sierra Leone and southern Guinea, where the bird is still locally common if difficult to locate.  ",1
7651,"It is estimated that only 2,500 to 10,000 white-necked rockfowl survive, with the population dwindling and spread out over a known 32 sites; however, most individuals studying this species believe that the population is far fewer than the 10,000 maximum.   Many of its colonies are currently approaching the minimum population size necessary to guarantee long-term viability against inbreeding.  ",1
7652,The primary threat is the commercial destruction of its habitat for timber.  ,1
7653,"Although the white-necked rockfowl is capable of withstanding some disturbance of the nearby habitat, as demonstrated by one colony surviving after it was completely surrounded by a cocoa plantation, habitat disturbance is far more likely to negatively impact on breeding success.   ",1
7654,"Most of the remaining colonies in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and CoÌte d'Ivoire are on protected land, while Liberia and Ghana's colonies are mostly unprotected.  ",1
7655,"In part to protect this species, Sierra Leone recently upgraded its protection of the Gola forest by turning it into its second national park, Gola National Park, and has announced that the country intends to work with Liberia to form a trans-national park protecting the Gola rainforest.  ",1
7656,"In return for lost logging rights, Sierra Leone has compensated locals with road and school renovations, additional training for police officers, and construction of churches and a mosque.  ",1
7657,"Liberia has also expressed a desire to expand its national park system, which would help protect the species.  ",1
7658,"In Guinea, the bird's forests are being logged to provide land for rice farming to help support farmers immigrating from the country's drier north.  ",1
7659,"Laws exist in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to protect this species, but enforcement is minimal.   ",1
7660,"International trading of the white-necked rockfowl is regulated as the bird is currently listed under CITES Appendix I. Additionally, in 2004 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species.  ",1
7661,"This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.  ",1
7662,"In 2006, BirdLife International received a US$19,900 grant from the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund to help enact this plan.  ",1
7663,Surveys conducted with this funding have resulted in the discovery of additional populations in Sierra Leone.  ,1
7664,"Additionally, wardens have been trained to protect Sierra Leone's Western Area Forest Reserve.  ",1
7665,"This plan, coupled with the bird's appearance and unusual habits, have led it to become a flagship species for habitat conservation across Africa and particularly in its upper Guinean forests.  ",1
7666,"Until 2003, the species was thought to be extinct in Ghana. ",0
7667,"Most of the Ghanaian sites from which it is known are active forest reserves, where logging periodically occurs. ",0
7668,"Outside of the reserves, bush-burning and mining for gold and other metals threaten remaining habitat. ",0
7669,"Following its rediscovery in Ghana, the Ghana Wildlife Society has begun to survey remaining habitat and implement conservation strategies.  ",1
7670,"In the 1950s and 1960s, collecting this species for display in zoos was a major threat, and in Liberia in particular this practice destroyed several of the bird's colonies.   ",1
7671,"The rockfowl were captured by the indigenous peoples through the use of traps, while hunters in Guinea, who were already catching rodents and hyraxes at the bird's nesting colonies, sometimes captured rockfowl at night.  ",1
7672,"Despite over 70 white-necked rockfowl being displayed in zoos during the 1970s, captive breeding was a rare occurrence and no stable captive populations have been formed.  ",1
7673,"Despite this, zoos did have limited success and at least one zoo was able to hand-rear a white-necked rockfowl.  ",1
7674,"As of 2002, no white-necked rockfowl have existed outside of Africa since 1998.[34 ",0
7675,The white-rumped swallow (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) is a species of bird in the family Hirundinidae. ,0
7676,"First described and given its binomial name by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817, it was for many years considered a subspecies of the Chilean swallow. ",0
7677,"It has a white supraloral streak, or streak above its lores (the region between a bird's eye and nostrils), which can be used to differentiate it from the Chilean swallow. ",0
7678,"The lores, ear coverts, tail, and wings are black, with white tips on the inner secondaries, tertials, and greater coverts of the wings. ",0
7679,"Its underparts and underwing-coverts are white, in addition to the rump, as the name suggests. ",0
7680,"The sexes are similar, and the juvenile is duller and browner with a dusky breast. ",0
7681,This species usually builds its nest in holes in trees or dead snags or under or in artificial structures like fence posts and the eaves of buildings. ,0
7682,The white-rumped swallow is solitary and nests in distributed pairs during the breeding season. ,0
7683,The breeding season is from October to December in Brazil and from October to February in neighboring Argentina. ,0
7684,"Usually, only one brood with four to seven eggs is laid, although a second one will occasionally be laid. ",0
7685,"The female incubates the eggs over a period usually between 15 and 16 days, with the fledging after usually between 21 and 25 days. ",0
7686,"This swallow is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. ",0
7687,"Its natural habitats are dry savanna, pastureland, the edge of forests, and subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland. ",0
7688,It is classified as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ,0
7689,Its population is increasing and it may benefit from the increase in availability of artificial nest sites. ,0
7690,The shiny cowbird is an occasional brood parasite of the white-rumped swallow. ,0
7691,The white-rumped swallow was first formally described as Hirundo leucorrhoa by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.  ,1
7692,"It was since moved to its current genus, Tachycineta, which was created in 1850 by Jean Cabanis.  ",1
7693,"Tachycineta is from takhukinetos, ""moving quickly"", and the specific leucorrhoa is from leukos, ""white"", and orrhos, ""rump"".  ",1
7694,"The species was formerly considered a subspecies of the Chilean swallow, most likely due to the similarity in morphology and calls. ",0
7695,"It is occasionally placed in the genus Iridoprocne with the tree swallow, mangrove swallow, white-winged swallow, and Chilean swallow.  ",1
7696,"A study of the mitochondrial DNA of Tachycineta supports the split, although studies do show that the white-rumped swallow forms a superspecies, leucorrhoa, with the Chilean swallow.   ",1
7697,"This species is monotypic, with no known subspecies.  This swallow is named for its white rump but it is also sometimes called the white-browed swallow, due to its white supraloral streak.  ",1
7698,The white-rumped swallow measures 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in length and weighs 17â21 grams (0.60â0.74 oz). ,0
7699,"It has a white supraloral streak,  a white streak above its eye, and black lores and ear coverts. ",1
7700,"It has black wings, with white tips on its inner secondaries, tertials, and greater wing-coverts. ",0
7701,"The white-rumped swallow also has, as the name implies, a white rump. ",0
7702,The rump is not totally white; it has some fine shaft streaks. ,0
7703,"The rest of the upperparts, in addition to the crown, nape, and forehead, are a glossy blue. ",0
7704,"These features, when this bird is not breeding, are more greenish-blue. ",0
7705,"The bill, legs, and feet are black, and the irides are brown. ",0
7706,"The sexes are alike, and the juvenile can be distinguished by its dusky breast and the fact that it is duller and more brownish.   ",1
7707,This swallow is similar to the Chilean swallow but can be differentiated by the Chilean swallow's lack of a supraloral white streak.  ,1
7708,The Chilean swallow also seems to keep its glossy blue upperparts when not breeding.  ,1
7709,"The white-rumped swallow is, in addition, larger than the Chilean swallow.  ",1
7710,The song of the white-rumped swallow is often described as a soft gurgling  or a broken warble. ,1
7711,"This swallow is native to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.  ",1
7712,"It inhabits open and semi-open country near water, the edge of woodland, and human settlements.  ",1
7713,"It also occurs in dry savannas, degraded former forest, and both subtropical and tropical seasonally flooded grassland.  ",1
7714,It is additionally known to occur in the pampas of Argentina and Uruguay. ,0
7715,"During the austral winter, the birds in the southern population usually move to the northern parts of its range.  ",1
7716,"This bird can be found at altitudes ranging from sea level to 1,100 metres (3,600 ft).  ",1
7717,"After the breeding season, the white-rumped swallow forms flocks that sometimes consist of hundreds of individuals.  ",1
7718,These flocks frequently consist of both the white-rumped swallow and other species of swallows.  ,1
7719,The white-rumped swallow builds nests in holes or crevices in a tree or dead snag. ,0
7720,"It also builds them in artificial structures like holes in fence posts or under eaves, typically under those of abandoned buildings.  ",1
7721,"This swallow will sometimes reuse favourable nest sites, which has a positive effect on fledgling survival.  ",1
7722,The nests themselves are usually made of plant fibres and lined with hair and feathers. ,0
7723,"This swallow is solitary and,  during the breeding season, is scattered in pairs.  ",1
7724,Pairs can be seen to fight and chase each other at the nest site.  ,1
7725,"This swallow displays nest prospecting behaviour, visiting potential future nesting sites. ",0
7726,"Nest prospecting is a behaviour recorded in both breeding and non-breeding individuals, and occurs both after the failure or success of a nest and while the bird is actively nesting. ",0
7727,"After a nest failure, the average distance an individual travels during a prospecting visit increases dramatically, from about 121 metres (397 ft) to about 5,119 metres (16,795 ft). ",0
7728,Nest prospecting seems to occur more frequently in individuals with a smaller clutch size. ,0
7729,"Male visits to other nests could be to care for extra-pair young, although it does not explain female visits.  Extra-pair young, or young with parents outside of the breeding pair, account for about 56 percent of all offspring.  ",1
7730,"The breeding season of the white-rumped swallow is from October to December in Brazil, and from October to February in Argentina.  ",1
7731,"During this period, one brood is usually laid, although it will occasionally lay a second brood.  ",1
7732,"On average, 58 percent of nests will fledge at least one chick.  ",1
7733,The clutch is usually four to seven eggs that transition from pinkish-white when laid to pure white. ,0
7734,The eggs measure 19.6 by 13.7 millimetres (0.77 in Ã 0.54 in) and weigh 1.9 grams (0.067 oz) on average.  Clutch size and egg size are noted to usually decrease as the breeding season progresses. ,1
7735,"It takes 15 to 16 days for the female to incubate the clutch.  About 58 percent of the broods hatch synchronously, although the hatching sometimes lasts over four days.  On average, 78 percent of the eggs will hatch. ",1
7736,"The fledging period is 21 to 25 days, with about 95 percent of the nestlings fledging.  ",1
7737,"The white-rumped swallow is an aerial insectivore that usually feeds alone or in small groups, feeding on flies, beetles, flying ants, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera. ",0
7738,"It follows humans and other animals,  and can usually be seen near humans and animals that are disturbing insects.  ",1
7739,The shiny cowbird is a brood parasite that occasionally lays its eggs in the nest of white-rumped swallow. ,0
7740,"After a shiny cowbird fledges, it exhibits behaviour that causes it to be fed more, much to the detriment of white-rumped swallow nestlings. ",0
7741,"This swallow has been known to lose nests to the southern house wren, a subspecies of the house wren.  ",1
7742,The white-rumped swallow is classified as a least-concern species by the IUCN. ,0
7743,"This is due to its large range, estimated to be 5,580,000 square kilometres (2,150,000 sq mi), its increase in population, and its large population.  Increase in the availability of artificial nest sites may benefit this bird,  and could be a factor in its increasing population.  ",1
7744,"The white-winged fairywren (Malurus leucopterus) is a species of passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae. ",0
7745,It lives in the drier parts of Central Australia; from central Queensland and South Australia across to Western Australia. ,0
7746,"Like other fairywrens, this species displays marked sexual dimorphism and one or more males of a social group grow brightly coloured plumage during the breeding season. ",0
7747,"The female is sandy-brown with light-blue tail feathers; it is smaller than the male, which, in breeding plumage, has a bright-blue body, black bill, and white wings. ",0
7748,Younger sexually mature males are almost indistinguishable from females and are often the breeding males. ,0
7749,"In spring and summer, a troop of white-winged fairywrens has a brightly coloured older male accompanied by small, inconspicuous brown birds, many of which are also male. ",0
7750,"Apart from the mainland subspecies, one is found on Dirk Hartog Island, and another on Barrow Island off the coast of Western Australia. ",0
7751,Males from these islands have black rather than blue breeding plumage. ,0
7752,"The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing this with small fruits and leaf buds. ",0
7753,"It occurs in heathland and arid scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. ",0
7754,"Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round. ",0
7755,Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. ,0
7756,These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. ,0
7757,"Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising the young from other pairings. ",0
7758,"As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds. ",0
7759,"A specimen of the white-winged fairywren was first collected by French naturalists Jean ReneÌ Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in September 1818, on Louis de Freycinet's voyage around the Southern Hemisphere. ",0
7760,"The specimen was subsequently lost in a shipwreck, but a painting entitled MeÌrion leucopteÌre by Jacques Arago survived and led to the bird's description in 1824 by French ornithologist Charles Dumont de Sainte-Croix.   ",1
7761,"The name for the species was derived from the Ancient Greek leuko- ""white"" and pteron ""wing"".  ",1
7762,"Ironically, the original specimen was of the black-plumaged subspecies from Dirk Hartog Island, which was not recorded again for 80 years. ",0
7763,"Meanwhile, the widespread blue-plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by John Gould in 1865.  ",1
7764,"He called one specimen collected from inland New South Wales the white-winged superb warbler (M. cyanotus), while another, which appeared to have a white back and wings, was described as the white-backed superb warbler (M. leuconotus). ",0
7765,It was not until the early 20th century that both of these blue-plumaged mainland forms were found to be of a single species.  ,1
7766,"George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, considered the specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of the genus,  and more recent studies have followed suit.  ",1
7767,"The back region between the shoulders is in fact bare, with feathers that arise from the shoulder (scapular) region and sweep inwards in different patterns. ",0
7768,This variation confused the early naturalists who described the white-backed and blue-backed species.  ,1
7769,"The white-winged fairywren was often referred to as the blue-and-white wren, and early observers, such as Norman Favaloro of Victoria, refer to them by this name.  ",1
7770,"However, like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is unrelated to the true wren (family Troglodytidae). ",0
7771,"Other alternative names used include the white-backed fairywren, white-backed wren and white-winged wren. ",0
7772,"It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae,   and later as a member of the warbler family, Sylviidae,  before they were placed in the newly recognised Australasian wren family, Maluridae, in 1975.  ",1
7773,"More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the family Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.   ",1
7774,The white-winged fairywren is one of eleven species in the genus Malurus. ,0
7775,"It is most closely related to the Australian red-backed fairywren, with which it makes up a  phylogenetic clade with the white-shouldered fairywren of New Guinea as the next closest relative.  ",1
7776,"Termed the bicoloured wrens by ornithologist Richard Schodde, these three species are notable for their lack of head patterns and ear tufts and their uniform black or blue plumage with contrasting shoulder or wing colour; they replace each other geographically across northern Australia and New Guinea.  ",1
7777,Both black-plumaged forms have been called the black-and-white fairywren and black-and-white wren. ,0
7778,"M. l. leucopterus and M. l. edouardi are both generally smaller than their mainland relatives, and both subspecies tend to have smaller family groups that consist of only one male and one female, with an occasional helper bird.  ",1
7779,"While the island subspecies and mainland species have been found to have similar social structure, breeding pairs on both islands have, on average, smaller clutches, longer incubation times, and fewer live fledglings.  ",1
7780,"Additionally, while M. l. leuconotus is considered of least concern by the IUCN due to its widespread occurrence, both island subspecies are considered vulnerable by the Australian government due to their delicate nesting sites that are easily disturbed by human construction and habitation.  ",1
7781,Both island subspecies are nearer in genetic distance to mainland populations of leuconotus than to each other;  ,1
7782,Dirk Hartog Island is 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the mainland while Barrow Island is 56 kilometres (35 mi) from the mainland. ,0
7783,"Gene flow between the populations existed at the beginning of the present interglacial period, some 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, at a time when sea levels were lower and both islands connected with the mainland.  ",1
7784,There are three theories as to how the three races of white-winged fairywren could have evolved. ,0
7785,"The first suggests that black-and-white plumage is an ancestral condition and, following separation of the three populations, blue-and-white plumage evolved in the mainland species.  ",1
7786,The second hypothesis suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved convergently on the two separate islands.  ,1
7787,"The third suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.  ",1
7788,The distribution of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. ,0
7789,"Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.  ",1
7790,"Measuring 11 to 13.5 centimetres (4.3 to 5.3 in) in length, white-winged fairywrens are one of the two smallest species of Malurus.  ",1
7791,Males typically weigh between 7.2 and 10.9 grams (0.25 and 0.38 oz) while females weigh between 6.8 and 11 grams (0.24 and 0.39 oz).  ,1
7792,"Averaging 8.5 mm (0.3 in) in males and 8.4 mm (0.3 in) in females,  the bill is relatively long, narrow and pointed and wider at the base.  ",1
7793,"Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs.  ",1
7794,"It is finer and more pointed in this species than in other fairywrens.  Fully mature adults are sexually dimorphic, with the male being larger and differing in colour from the female. ",1
7795,"The adult female is sandy-brown with a very light blue tail, and a pinkish buff bill. ",0
7796,"The male in breeding plumage has a black bill, white wings and shoulders, and a wholly cobalt blue or black body (depending on subspecies).  ",1
7797,These contrasting white feathers are especially highlighted in flight and ground displays in breeding season.  ,1
7798,"The male in eclipse plumage resembles the female, though it may be distinguished by its darker bill.  Both sexes have long, slender, distinct tails held at an upward angle from their bodies.  Measuring around 6.25 centimetres (2.46 in), the tail feathers have a white fringe, which disappears with wear.  Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown bills with shorter tails than adults. ",1
7799,"Young males develop blue tail feathers and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. ",0
7800,"By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. ",0
7801,"In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies. Males entering their second or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. ",1
7802,"By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white while the rest of their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. ",0
7803,"All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage.  ",1
7804,"The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules.  ",1
7805,"The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.  ",1
7806,"In 1980, Tideman characterised five different patterns of calls among Malurus leucopterus leuconotus; these were recognised by Pruett and Jones among the island subspecies M. l. edouardi. ",0
7807,The main call is a reel made by both sexes in order to establish territory and unify the group. ,0
7808,"It is a long song of ""rising and falling notes"" that is first signaled by 3â5 chip notes. ",0
7809,"Although seemingly weak in sound, the reel carries a long way above the stunted shrubland. ",0
7810,"A harsh trit call is often used to establish contact (especially between mothers and their young) and to raise alarm; it is characterised by a series of ""loud and abrupt"" calls that vary in frequency and intensity. ",0
7811,Adults will use a high-pitched peep that may be made intermittently with reels as a contact call to birds that are more distant. ,0
7812,"Nestlings, fledglings, and females around the nest will use high pipsâquiet, high-pitched, and short calls. ",0
7813,"When used by a mature female, they are mixed with harsh calls. ",0
7814,"Nestlings may also make ""gurgling"" noises when they are being fed. ",0
7815,"The white-winged fairywren is well adapted to dry environments, and M.l. leuconotus is found throughout arid and semi-arid environments between latitudes 19 and 32oS in mainland Australia. ",0
7816,"It occupies coastal Western Australia from around Port Hedland south to Perth, and stretches eastwards over to Mount Isa in Queensland, and along the western parts of the Great Dividing Range through central Queensland and central western New South Wales, into the northwestern corner of Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula and across the Nullarbor.  ",1
7817,"It commonly cohabits with other species of fairywren, including the purple-backed fairy-wren (M. lamberti assimilis). ",0
7818,"White-winged fairywrens often inhabit heathlands or treeless shrublands dominated by saltbush (Atriplex) and small shrubs of the genus Maireana, or grasses such as tussock grass (Triodia) and cane-grass (Zygochloa), as well as floodplain areas vegetated with lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta).   ",1
7819,M. l. leucopterus inhabits similar habitats on Dirk Hartog Island and M. l. edouardi does the same on Barrow Island.  ,1
7820,The white-winged fairywren is replaced to the north of its range on mainland Australia by the red-backed fairywren.  ,1
7821,"The usual form of locomotion is hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. ",0
7822,"Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. ",0
7823,"The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.  White-winged fairywrens live in complex social groups.[38 ",1
7824,"] Clans consist of 2â4 birds, typically one brown or partially blue male and a breeding female. ",0
7825,"Nest helpers are birds raised in previous years which remain with the family group after fledging and assist in raising young;  they may be male that have retained their brown plumage, or ",1
7826,"Several subgroups live within one territory and make up a clan, which is presided over by one blue (or black) male who assumes breeding plumage. ",0
7827,"While the blue male is dominant to the rest of the brown and partially blue males within his clan, he nests with only one female and contributes to the raising of only her young. ",0
7828,It is unclear whether or not he fathers young in any of the other nests within his territory.  ,1
7829,Each clan has a specified area of land that all members contribute to foraging from and defending. ,0
7830,"Frequently, territory sizes, normally 4 to 6 hectares (10 to 15 acres), are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful.  ",1
7831,"Additionally, the feeding territories are larger during the winter months when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. ",0
7832,"Observed in this species,  the wing-fluttering display is seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male courtship displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. ",1
7833,"The fairywren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.  ",1
7834,Both the male and female adult white-winged fairywren may utilise a rodent-run display to distract predators from nests with young birds. ,0
7835,"The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.  ",1
7836,"Fairywrens exhibit one of the highest incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. ",0
7837,"Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. ",0
7838,"In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals.  ",1
7839,"While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.  ",1
7840,"During another courtship display the male bows deeply forward facing the female, reaching the ground with his bill and spreading and flattening his plumage in a near-horizontal plane for up to 20 seconds. ",0
7841,"In this pose, the white plumage forms a striking white band across his darker plumage.  ",1
7842,"Breeding females begin to build their nests in the spring and construct domed structures composed of spider webs, fine grasses, thistle-down, and vegetable-down, typically 6 to 14 centimetres (2.4 to 5.5 in) tall and 3 to 9 millimetres (0.12 to 0.35 in) thick.  ",1
7843,Each nest has a small entrance on one side and they are normally placed in thick shrubs close to the ground. ,0
7844,"A clutch of 3â4 eggs is generally laid anywhere from September to January, with incubation lasting around 14 days.  ",1
7845,"The white-winged fairywren generally breeds in the spring in the southwest of Western Australia, but is more opportunistic in arid regions of central and northern Australia, with breeding recorded almost any month after a period of rainfall.  Incubation is by the breeding female alone, while the breeding male (a brown or blue male) and nest helpers aid in feeding the nestlings and removing their fecal sacs. ",1
7846,"The newly hatched nestlings are altricial, gaping immediately for food, and developing downy feather tracts and opening their eyes by the third or fourth day.  ",1
7847,"Nestlings remain in the nest for 10â11 days, and fledglings continue to be fed for 3â4 weeks following their departure from the nest. ",0
7848,Fledglings then either stay on to help raise the next brood or move to a nearby territory.  ,1
7849,"It is not unusual for a pair bond to hatch and raise two broods in one breeding season, and helpers tend to lessen the stress on the breeding female rather than increase the overall number of feedings.  Like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is particularly prone to parasitic nesting by the Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chalcites basalis). ",1
7850,Parasitism by the shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) and black-eared cuckoo (C. osculans) is rarely recorded.  ,1
7851,"The white-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders.  ",1
7852,"The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. ",0
7853,"Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire.  ",1
7854,"During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. ",0
7855,"Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. ",0
7856,The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. ,0
7857,Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.[41 ,0
7858,"Adults and their young may be preyed upon by mammalian predators, such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas.   ",1
7859,Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden close to the ground and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.[8 ,0
7860,"The willie (or willy) wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys) is a passerine bird native to Australia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Eastern Indonesia. ",0
7861,"It is a common and familiar bird throughout much of its range, living in most habitats apart from thick forest. ",0
7862,"Measuring 19â21.5 cm (7 1â2â8 1â2 in) in length, the willie wagtail is contrastingly coloured with almost entirely black upperparts and white underparts; the male and female have similar plumage. ",0
7863,"Three subspecies are recognised;  Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys from central and southern Australia, the smaller R. l. picata from northern Australia, and the larger R. l. melaleuca from New Guinea and islands in its vicinity. ",0
7864,"It is unrelated to the true wagtails of the genus Motacilla; it is a member of the fantail genus Rhipidura and is a part of a ""core corvine"" group that includes true crows and ravens, drongos and birds of paradise. ",0
7865,"Within this group, fantails are placed either in the family Dicruridae, alongside drongos, or in their own small family, Rhipiduridae. ",0
7866,The willie wagtail is insectivorous and spends much time chasing prey in open habitat. ,0
7867,Its common name is derived from its habit of wagging its tail horizontally when foraging on the ground. ,0
7868,"Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. ",0
7869,"It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. ",0
7870,"It is widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around Australia and New Guinea in a variety of roles, from stealer of secrets and liar to a good omen for successful crops. ",0
7871,The willie wagtail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Turdus leucophrys.  ,1
7872,"Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words leukos ""white"" and oÌphrys ""eyebrow"".  Other early scientific names include Muscicapa tricolor by Vieillot,  and Rhipidura motacilloides by naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, who erected the genus Rhipidura.  ",1
7873,"The generic term is derived from the Ancient Greek rhipis ""fan"" and oura ""tail"".  John Gould and other early writers referred to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. ",1
7874,"Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure.  ",1
7875,"The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba) on the Isle of Man,  and Northern Ireland.  ",1
7876,"Other vernacular names applied include shepherd's companion (because it accompanied livestock), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale.  ",1
7877,"Many Aboriginal names are onomatopoeic, based on the sound of its scolding call.  Djididjidi is a name from the Kimberley,  and djikirridj-djikirridj is used by the Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land.   ",1
7878,"In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara word is tjintir-tjintir(pa).  ",1
7879,"In Bougainville Island, it is called tsiropen in the Banoni language from the west coast,  and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is maneka.  ",1
7880,"In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the polis (police) or pris (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring. ",0
7881,The willie wagtail is unrelated to the Eurasian wagtails of the family Motacillidae. ,0
7882,It is one of 47 members of the fantail genus Rhipidura; some authorities classify this group of birds as a subfamily ,0
7883,"Rhipidurinae within the drongo family Dicruridae, together with the monarch flycatchers,  while others consider them distinct enough to warrant their own family Rhipiduridae.  ",1
7884,Early molecular research in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed that the fantails belong to a large group of mainly Australasian birds known as the parvorder Corvida comprising many tropical and Australian passerines.  ,1
7885,"More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat and the fantails have been classified in a ""core corvine"" group with the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, monarch flycatchers, drongos and mudnest builders.  ",1
7886,"An adult willie wagtail is between 19 and 21.5 cm (7.5 and 8.5 in) in length and weighs 17â24 g (0.6â0.85 oz), with a tail 10â11 cm (approx 4 in) long. ",0
7887,"The short, slender bill measures 1.64â1.93 cm (around 0.75 in),  and is tipped with a small hook.  ",1
7888,"This species has longer legs than other fantails, which may be an adaptation to foraging on the ground.  ",1
7889,"The male and female have similar plumage; the head, throat, upper breast, wings, upperparts, and tail are all black, with a white eyebrow, ""whiskers"" and underparts. ",0
7890,The bill and legs are black and the iris dark brown. ,0
7891,"Immature birds in their first year after moulting from juvenile plumage may have pale tips in their wings,  while juvenile birds themselves have duller plumage, their upperparts ",1
7892,"The wagtail is very ""chatty"" and has a number of distinct vocalisations. ",0
7893,"Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. ",0
7894,The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. ,0
7895,"John Gould reported that it sounded like a child's rattle or ""small cog-wheels of a steam mill"".  ",1
7896,"(1935), Neville Cayley writes that it has ""a pleasant call resembling sweet pretty little creature, frequently uttered during the day or night, especially on moonlight nights"".  ",1
7897,"Widespread and abundant, the willie wagtail is found across most of Australia and New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and eastern Indonesia. ",0
7898,"It is sedentary across most of Australia, though some areas have recorded seasonal movements; it is an autumn and winter visitor to northeastern New South Wales and southeast Queensland, as well as the Gulf Country and parts of Cape York Peninsula in the far north. ",0
7899,"It is a vagrant to Tasmania,  and on occasion reaches Lord Howe Island.  There is one record from Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands archipelago east of New Zealand in 2002.  ",1
7900,"The willie wagtail was released in Hawaii around 1922 to control insects on livestock, but the introduction was unsuccessful and the last sighting was at Koko Head in 1937.  ",1
7901,"The willie wagtail is at home in a wide variety of habitats, but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest. ",0
7902,"It prefers semi-open woodland or grassland with scattered trees,  often near wetlands or bodies of water.  ",1
7903,"In New Guinea, it inhabits man-made clearings and grasslands, as well as open forest and mangroves.  ",1
7904,"On Guadalcanal, it was reported from open areas and coconut groves.  ",1
7905,"It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed areas such as lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds.  ",1
7906,The species spread into the Western Australian Wheatbelt after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.  ,1
7907,The willie wagtail is almost always on the move and rarely still for more than a few moments during daylight hours. ,0
7908,"Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. ",0
7909,"Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs,  although they may gather in small flocks.  Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground.  ",1
7910,"It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. ",0
7911,It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.  ,1
7912,"The willie wagtail is highly territorial and can be quite fearless in defence of its territory; it will harry not only small birds but also much larger species such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), raven (Corvus coronoides), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), and wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax).  ",1
7913,"It may even attack domestic dogs, cats and humans which approach its nest too closely. ",0
7914,It has also been observed harassing snake-neck turtles and tiger snakes in Western Australia. ,0
7915,"When harassing an opponent, the willie wagtail avoids the head and aims for the rear.  ",1
7916,"Both the male and female may engage in this behaviour, and generally more intensely in the breeding season. ",0
7917,A pair of birds will declare and defend their territory against other pairs in a diving display. ,0
7918,One bird remains still while the other loops and dives repeatedly before the roles are reversed; both sing all the while.  ,1
7919,"The bird's white eyebrows become flared and more prominent in an aggressive display, and settled and more hidden when in a submissive or appeasement display.  ",1
7920,"The breeding season lasts from July to December, more often occurring after rain in drier regions. ",0
7921,Anywhere up to four broods may be raised during this time. ,0
7922,"It builds a cup-like nest on a tree branch away from leaves or cover, less than 5 m (16 ft) above the ground. ",0
7923,"It has been observed to build its nest in the vicinity of those of the magpie-lark (Grallina cyanoleuca), possibly taking advantage of the latter bird's territoriality and aggression toward intruders. ",0
7924,"The nest consists of grass stems, strips of bark, and other fibrous material which is bound and woven together with spider web. ",0
7925,It has also been observed attempting to take hair from a pet goat. ,0
7926,An alpaca breeder in the Mudgee District of New South Wales has observed alpaca fleece in the nests of willy wagtails (the results of scraps of fleece not picked up at shearing time). ,0
7927,"The female lays two to four small cream-white eggs with brownish markings measuring 16 mm Ã 21 mm (0.63 in Ã 0.83 in),  and incubates them for 14 days.  ",1
7928,"Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial and nidicolous; they are born naked and helpless with closed eyes, and remain in the nest.  ",1
7929,"Both parents take part in feeding the young,   and may continue to do so while embarking on another brood.  ",1
7930,Nestlings remain in the nest for around 14 days before fledging.  ,1
7931,"Upon leaving, the fledglings will remain hidden in cover nearby for one or two days before venturing further afield, up to 20 m (66 ft) away by the third day. ",0
7932,"Parents will stop feeding their fledglings near the end of the second week, as the young birds increasingly forage for themselves, and soon afterwards drive them out of the territory.  ",1
7933,"The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) will lay eggs in a willie wagtail nest, although the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare.  ",1
7934,"Parasitism by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) has also been reported.  ",1
7935,"Although the willie wagtail is an aggressive defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. ",0
7936,"About two thirds of eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. ",0
7937,"Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), as well as the feral cat (Felis catus), and rat species. ",0
7938,The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.  ,1
7939,Mostly male willie wagtails sing at night only during breeding season. ,0
7940,"The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, watching for insects and other small invertebrates in the air or on the ground. ",0
7941,"It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. ",0
7942,"It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing.  ",1
7943,It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch.  ,1
7944,"The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo.  ",1
7945,"It kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.  ",1
7946,"The adaptability and opportunistic diet of the willie wagtail have probably assisted it in adapting to human habitation; it eats a wide variety of arthropods, including butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, dragonflies, bugs, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes,  and has been recorded killing small lizards such as skinks and geckos in a study in Madang on Papua New Guinea's north coast.  ",1
7947,The tailbones of these lizards have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. ,0
7948,"Either way, lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet.  Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.  ",1
7949,"Aboriginal tribes in parts of southeastern Australia, such as the Ngarrindjeri of the Lower Murray River, and the Narrunga People of the Yorke Peninsula,  regard the willie wagtail as the bearer of bad news.  ",1
7950,"It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person's secrets while lingering around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped in the presence of the bird.   ",1
7951,The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. ,0
7952,They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals.  ,1
7953,"Its cleverness is also seen in a Tinputz tale of Bougainville Island, where Singsing Tongereng (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle.  ",1
7954,"However, the Kunwinjku in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a tattletale.  ",1
7955,"The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a dreaming story of the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened.  ",1
7956,"In the Noongar language dialects, the willie wagtail is known as the Djiti-Djiti (pronounced Chitti-chitti) and the Willaring in the Perth region.  ",1
7957,"The Kalam people of New Guinea highlands called it konmayd, and deemed it a good bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, then there would be good crops. ",0
7958,It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. ,0
7959,"It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam.  Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. ",1
7960,She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.  ,1
7961,"A tale from the Kieta district of Bougainville Island relates that a maneka, the willie wagtail, darting along a river bank echoes a legendary daughter looking for her mother who drowned trying to cross a flooding river in a storm.  ",1
7962,"The bird has been depicted on postage stamps in Palau and the Solomon Islands,  and has also appeared as a character in Australian children's literature, such as  Dot and the Kangaroo (1899),  ",1
7963,"Blinky Bill Grows Up (1935),  and Willie Wagtail and Other Tales ",1
7964,The wood stork (Mycteria americana) is a large American wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. ,0
7965,"It was formerly called the ""wood ibis"", though it is not an ibis. ",0
7966,"It is found in subtropical and tropical habitats in the Americas, including the Caribbean. ",0
7967,"In South America, it is resident, but in North America, it may disperse as far as Florida. ",0
7968,"Originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, this stork likely evolved in tropical regions. ",0
7969,"The head and neck are bare of feathers, and dark grey in colour. ",0
7970,"The plumage is mostly white, with the exception of the tail and some of the wing feathers, which are black with a greenish-purplish sheen. ",0
7971,"The juvenile differs from the adult, with the former having a feathered head and a yellow bill, compared to the black adult bill. ",0
7972,"The habitat of the wood stork can vary, but it must have a tropical or subtropical climate with fluctuating water levels. ",0
7973,"The one-metre-diameter (3.3-foot) nest is found in trees, especially mangroves and those of the genus Taxodium, usually surrounded by water or over water. ",0
7974,"During the breeding season, which is initiated when the water levels drop and can occur anytime between November and August, a single clutch of three to five eggs is laid. ",0
7975,"These are incubated for around 30 days, and the chicks hatch altricial. ",0
7976,"They fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching, although only about 31% of nests fledge a chick in any given year, with most chicks dying during their first two weeks, despite being watched by an adult during that time. ",0
7977,"During the dry season, fish and insects are eaten, compared to the addition of frogs and crabs during the wet season. ",0
7978,"Because it forages by touch, it needs shallow water to effectively catch food. ",0
7979,This is also the reason why the wood stork breeds when water levels start to fall. ,0
7980,"Globally, the wood stork is considered to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ",0
7981,"In the United States, on the other hand, it is considered to be threatened. ",0
7982,"Predators of the wood stork include raccoons (which predate on chicks), northern crested caracaras, which prey on eggs, and other birds of prey, which feed on both eggs and chicks. ",0
7983,Hunting and egg-collecting by humans has been implicated as a factor in the decline of South American wood storks. ,0
7984,"Humans also cause nest failures through ecotourism, although observation through binoculars about 75 metres (246 ft) away does not have a large effect on nesting success. ",0
7985,"In both North and South America, habitat alteration has caused the wood stork to decline, with levee and drainage systems in the Everglades causing a shift in the timing of breeding and thus a decrease in breeding success. ",0
7986,The wood stork was first formally described and given its binomial name Mycteria americana by Linnaeus in 1758.[2 ,0
7987,] Linnaeus based his description on a misplaced account and illustration in Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648)  of the jabiru-guacu. ,1
7988,"Linnaeus also described Tantalus loculator, which was proven to also apply to the jabiru-guacu, after M. americana based on a 1731 illustration of the wood stork by Mark Catesby under the name of wood pelican.  ",1
7989,"Since these binomials referred to the same species, M. americana and T. loculator are synonymous but M. americana takes priority as it occurs before T. loculator.  ",1
7990,"The accepted genus name derives from the Greek mykter, meaning snout, and the species name references the distribution of this stork.  Wood stork Yellow-billed stork Milky stork Painted stork This species seems to have evolved in tropical regions; its North American presence probably postdates the last ice age. ",1
7991,"A fossil fragment from the Touro Passo Formation found at Arroio Touro Passo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) might be of the living species; it is at most from the Late Pleistocene age, a few 10,000s of years ago.  ",1
7992,"North American fossils from that time are of an extinct larger relative, M. wetmorei, which would be distinguished from the wood on the basis of size and on the basis of M. wetmorei's less curved mandible. ",0
7993,"This was probably a sister species; both occurred sympatrically on Cuba at the end of the Pleistocene.  Of the extant members of the genus Mycteria, this bird is basal to the clade yellow-billed stork, which is itself basal to the milky stork and the painted stork. ",1
7994,This phylogeny is based on a 1996 study that sequenced the B chromosome and then utilized DNAâDNA hybridization to find the relations between the storks.  ,1
7995,"Likely because of its decurved bill, the wood stork has formerly been called the ""wood ibis"", although it is not an ibis.  ",1
7996,"It also has been given the name of the ""American wood stork"", because it is found in the Americas.  Regional names include ""flinthead"", ""stonehead"", ""ironhead"", ""gourdhead"", and ""preacher"".  ",1
7997,The adult wood stork is a large bird which stands 83 to 115 cm (33â45 in) tall with a wingspan of 140 to 180 cm (55â71 in). ,0
7998,"The male typically weighs 2.5 to 3.3 kg (5.5â7.3 lb), with a mean weight of 2.7 kg (6.0 lb); the female weighs 2.0 to 2.8 kg (4.4â6.2 lb), with a mean weight of 2.42 kg (5.3 lb).   ",1
7999,"Another estimate puts the mean weight at 2.64 kg (5.8 lb).  The head and neck of the adult are bare, and the scaly skin is a dark grey. ",1
8000,The black downward-curved bill is long and very wide at the base. ,0
8001,"The plumage is mostly white, with the primaries, secondaries, and tail being black and having a greenish and purplish iridescence. ",0
8002,"The legs and feet are dark, and the flesh-coloured toes are pink during the breeding season. ",0
8003,"The sexes are similar.  Newly hatched chicks have a sparse coat of grey down (protoptiles) that is replaced by a dense, wooly, and white down (mesoptiles) in about 10 days. ",1
8004,"Chicks grow fast, being about half the height of adults in three to four weeks. ",0
8005,"By the sixth and seventh weeks, the plumage on the head and neck turns smokey grey. ",0
8006,"When fledged, they resemble the adult, differing only in that they have a feathered head and a yellow bill.  ",1
8007,"This is a subtropical and tropical species which breeds in much of South America, Central America and the Caribbean. ",0
8008,The wood stork is the only stork that breeds in North America. ,0
8009,"In the United States there are small breeding populations in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.  ",1
8010,"Some populations in North America disperse after breeding, frequently to South America.  ",1
8011,This stork is able to adapt to a variety of tropical and subtropical wetland habitats  having fluctuating water levels (as that initiates breeding).  It nests in trees that are over water or surrounded by water. ,1
8012,"In freshwater habitats, it primarily nests in forests dominated by trees of the genus Taxodium (in the USA), while in estuaries, it generally nests on trees in the mangrove forests.  ",1
8013,"To feed, the wood stork uses freshwater marshes in habitats with an abundance of Taxodium trees, while in areas with mangrove forests, it uses brackish water. ",0
8014,"Areas with more lakes attract feeding on lake, stream, and river edges.  ",1
8015,"A resident breeder in lowland wetlands with trees, the wood stork builds a large stick nest in a tree.  ",1
8016,"In freshwater habitats, it prefers to nest in trees that are larger in diameter.  ",1
8017,"It nests colonially, with up to 25 nests in one tree.  ",1
8018,"The height of these nests is variable, with some nests located in shorter mangrove trees being at heights of about 2.5 metres (8.2 ft), compared to a height of about 6.5 metres (21 ft) for taller mangrove trees.  ",1
8019,"For Taxodium trees, it generally nests near the top branches, frequently between 18 and 24 metres (59 and 79 ft) above the ground.  ",1
8020,"On the tree itself, forks of large limbs or places where multiple branches cross are usually chosen.  ",1
8021,The nest itself is built by the male  from sticks  and green twigs  collected from the colony and the surrounding area.  ,1
8022,The greenery usually starts to be added before the eggs are laid but after the main structure of twigs is completed. ,0
8023,The frequency at which it is added decreases after the eggs hatch. ,0
8024,"When complete, the nest is about one metre (3.3 ft) in diameter,  with a central green area having an average diameter of about 28 centimetres (11 in). ",1
8025,The thickness of the edge of the nest usually measures from 12 to 20 centimetres (4.7 to 7.9 in).[22 ,0
8026,] Wood storks without a nest occasionally try to take over others' nests. ,0
8027,The young and eggs are thrown out of the nest within about 15 minutes. ,0
8028,"If only one stork is attending the nest when it is forced out, then it usually waits for its mate to try to take the nest back over.  ",1
8029,Breeding is initiated by a drop in the water level combined with an increased density of fish (with the former likely triggering the latter). ,0
8030,This is because a decrease in the water level and an increased density of fish allows for an adequate amount of food for the nestlings.  This can occur anytime between November and August. ,1
8031,"After it starts, breeding takes about four months to complete. This bird lays one clutch of three to five cream coloured eggs that are about 68 by 46 millimetres (2.7 by 1.8 in) in size.  ",1
8032,These eggs are usually laid one to two days apart  and incubated for 27 to 32 days  by both sexes.  ,1
8033,"During the first week of incubation, the parents do not go far from the colony, with the exception of the short trips to forage, drink, and collect nesting material carried out by the non-incubating bird. ",0
8034,"After the first week, the non-incubating bird spends less time in the colony, although the eggs are never left unattended. ",0
8035,"After a few hours of incubation, this bird sometimes takes a break to stretch, preen itself, rearrange nest material, or turn the eggs.  ",1
8036,"The eggs hatch in the order in which they were laid, with an interval of a few days between when each egg hatches.  ",1
8037,"The chicks hatch altricial, unable to move, and weigh an average of 62 grams (2.2 oz).  ",1
8038,"They are brooded for the first week after hatching, and after that when it is raining and at night.  ",1
8039,"The chicks are not left alone until at least three weeks of age, with one parent foraging while the other guards the nest and chicks. ",0
8040,"When the chicks are at least three weeks old, they are large enough to stay and protect the nest. ",0
8041,This coincides with the chicks getting more aggressive when presented with foreign objects or organisms. ,0
8042,"They fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching,  and reach sexual maturity at four years of age, although they usually do not successfully fledge chicks until their fifth year of age.  ",1
8043,"The hatching success, the percentage of birds that had at least one egg that hatched in a year, of the wood stork is around 62%. ",0
8044,"This can vary widely, though, with colonies ranging from about 26% to 89% hatching success. ",0
8045,The period when chicks are most vulnerable to death is from hatching to when they are two weeks old.  ,1
8046,"Overall, about 31% of nests produce at least one fledged bird.  Raccoons  and caracaras, especially northern crested caracaras, are prominent predators of eggs and chicks. ",1
8047,"Other causes of nesting failure is the falling of nests, thus breaking the eggs inside. ",0
8048,"This can be caused by many events, the most prominent being poor nest construction and fights between adults.  ",1
8049,"During the dry season, the wood stork eats mostly fish, supplemented by insects. ",0
8050,"During the wet season, on the other hand, fish make up about half the diet, crabs make up about 30%, and insects and frogs make up the rest.  ",1
8051,"The wood stork eats larger fish more often than smaller fish, even in some cases where the latter is more abundant.  It is estimated that an adult wood stork needs about 520 grams (1.15 lb) per day to sustain itself. ",1
8052,"For a whole family, it is estimated that about 200 kilograms (440 lb) are needed per breeding season.  ",1
8053,"The wood stork usually forages in flocks when not breeding, and alone and in small groups when it is breeding. ",0
8054,"In the dry season, this bird generally forages by slowly walking forward with its bill submerged in the water while groping for food. ",0
8055,"During the wet season, this method is used about 40% of the time to catch food. ",0
8056,"During this period, foot stirring, where the stork walks very slowly with the bill in water while pumping its foot up and down before every step, is used about 35% of the time. ",0
8057,"Because of its non-visual foraging methods, the wood stork requires shallow water and a high density of fish to forage successfully. ",0
8058,"The water that it forages in during the dry season averages about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in depth, while during the wet season, the water usually is about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) deep. ",0
8059,"In the dry season, this stork prefers to forage in waters with no emergent vegetation, whereas in the wet season, it prefers areas with vegetation emerging between 10 and 20 centimetres (3.9 and 7.9 in) above the surface on average.  ",1
8060,"This bird can travel over 80 kilometres (50 mi) to reach foraging sites, lending it access to a wide variety of habitats.  ",1
8061,Both parents feed the chicks by regurgitating food onto the nest floor. ,0
8062,"The chicks are mainly fed fish that are between 2 and 25 centimetres (0.79 and 9.84 in) in length, with the length of the fish usually increasing as the chicks get older. ",0
8063,"The amount of food that the chicks get changes over time, with more being fed daily from hatching to about 22 days, when food intake levels off. ",0
8064,"This continues until about 45 days, when food consumption starts to decrease. ",0
8065,"Overall, a chick eats about 16.5 kilograms (36 lb) before it fledges.  ",1
8066,"When it is not sufficiently warm and clear, such as in the late afternoon or on cloudy days, this stork alternates between flapping its wings and gliding for short periods of time. ",0
8067,"When it is warm and clear, this bird glides after it gains an altitude of at least 610 metres (2,000 ft) through continuously flapping its wings. ",0
8068,It can then glide for distances ranging from 16 to 24 kilometres (9.9 to 14.9 mi). ,0
8069,It does not have to flap its wings during this time because the warm thermals are strong enough to support its weight.  ,1
8070,"Because of the energy that is conserved by soaring, this stork usually uses this method to fly to more distant areas.  ",1
8071,It flies with its neck outstretched and its legs and feet trailing behind it.  ,1
8072,"When flying to foraging areas, the wood stork averages a speed of about 24.5 kilometres per hour (15.2 mph). ",0
8073,"In flapping flight it does 34.5 kilometres per hour (21.4 mph), and about 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph) by gliding.  ",1
8074,"During the breeding season, the wood stork commonly defecates over the edge of its nest, while the chicks usually defecate inside.  ",1
8075,The method of defecation of the adult differs based on temperature. ,0
8076,"Normally, it excretes by leaning forward and slightly raising its tail, with the waste either going straight down or slightly backwards. ",0
8077,"When it is hot, though, the adult takes a different position, quickly moving its tail downwards and forwards while twisting its body around to aim at a leg that is bent backwards (this is called urohidrosis). ",0
8078,"It generally hits the legs around the middle of the unfeathered tibia, and runs down the leg as it is being directed by the scales. ",0
8079,"The temperature at which this starts is slightly above the threshold for panting, the latter of which takes place at temperatures of about 41.7 Â°C (107.1 Â°F) and above, compared to the normal body temperature of about 40.7 Â°C (105.3 Â° ",0
8080,"In hot weather, breeding adults will also shade their chicks with their wings.  Raccoons are predators of wood stork chicks,  especially during dry periods where the water beneath nesting trees dries up.  Where it occurs, the crested caracara is a significant predator of eggs. ",1
8081,"Other caracaras, and hawks and vultures, also prey on both eggs and chicks.  ",1
8082,"In the United States, Haemoproteus crumenium, a blood protozoan, can be found in subadult and adult wood storks.  ",1
8083,"Other species of Haemoproteus also infect wood storks in Costa Rica,  in addition to Syncuaria mycteriae, a nematode found in the gizzard of the wood stork.  ",1
8084,"Globally, the wood stork is considered least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its large range.  ",1
8085,"In the United States, this bird is considered to be threatened. ",0
8086,"This is a recovery from its former status as endangered, which it held from 1984 to 2014 because of a decline in its population  caused by habitat loss and drought.  ",1
8087,"Similarly, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, its decline seems to have been reversed: after an absence between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s, the species is now again regularly encountered there, in particular in the TubaraÌo River region.  ",1
8088,"It is likely that the ParanaÌ River region's wetlands served as a stronghold of the species, from where it is now re-colonizing some of its former haunts.  ",1
8089,"ThreatsDisturbance by tourists can have an effect on nesting success, with a study finding that nests that had boats passing by them within about 20 metres (66 ft) had an average of 0.1 chicks fledging, compared to the normal rate for that area of about 0.9 chicks fledging per nest. ",0
8090,Pedestrians watching from a distance of at least 75 metres (246 ft) did not significantly affect nesting success.  ,1
8091,"In the Everglades, levee and drainage systems have caused the timing of water fluctuations to change, thus shifting the timing of nesting and consequently a decrease in population.[30 ",0
8092,"The yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops) is a small to medium-sized bird in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. ",0
8093,It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. ,0
8094,"Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. ",0
8095,"It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. ",0
8096,"Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. ",0
8097,It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs. ,0
8098,"Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern New South Wales and Victoria. ",0
8099,They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup-shaped nest. ,0
8100,"The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season. ",0
8101,"Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. ",0
8102,"As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. ",0
8103,"The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae.   ",1
8104,"French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.  ",1
8105,"The specific name chrysops is derived from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.  ",1
8106,"The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.  Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic.  ",1
8107,"Five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. ",0
8108,"The generic name derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.  ",1
8109,The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus.  ,1
8110,"A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.  ",1
8111,"There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews in 1912.   ",1
8112,"There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the Atherton Tableland in Queensland. ",0
8113,"The latter race is described as ""poorly differentiated"" and ""possibly not worthy of recognition"" by the Handbook of the Birds of the World.  ",1
8114,"John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.  ",1
8115,"Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler.  John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,  which has become its official name. ",1
8116,"It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.  ",1
8117,"The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head.  ",1
8118,"Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the ear coverts. ",0
8119,"Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. ",0
8120,"The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. ",0
8121,Olive-green outer edges on the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. ,0
8122,"The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. ",0
8123,"The iris is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. ",0
8124,"The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. ",0
8125,"The yellow-faced honeyeater averages 15â17.5 centimetres (5.9â6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5â26 cm (8.5â10.2 in), and a weight of 12.5â20.5 grams (0.44â0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g ",0
8126,"One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. ",0
8127,"The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.  ",1
8128,"The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived.  ",1
8129,Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. ,0
8130,"The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. ",0
8131,"Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.  ",1
8132,"Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitatsâin open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in riparian woodlands. ",0
8133,"It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light, shrubby understorey, and less often in dry, open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). ",0
8134,"It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. ",0
8135,"It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. ",0
8136,"It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests.  ",1
8137,"Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.  ",1
8138,"The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near Cooktown in Far North Queensland, and between a line from Charters Towers south to Albury and the coast, and then west to the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. ",0
8139,"Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near Armidale in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at Tarnagulla, Victoria. ",0
8140,"During the winter months of June and July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following their northward migration.  ",1
8141,"There are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, but it is for the most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. ",0
8142,"During the autumn (March to May), it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring ",0
8143,"The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of 1,000 or more. ",0
8144,"The groups can include other species, such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird, and silvereye. ",0
8145,They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour.  ,1
8146,"Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings Point in New South Wales over the course of a single day in May 1965.  ",1
8147,"The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields, and uses them to navigate while migrating.[23 ",0
8148,"] Experiments, where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed, indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and the South Pole, rather than north and south.  ",1
8149,"Their flight is in one general direction, but is not in a straight line, as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges, and detour around cities.  ",1
8150,"The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water.  ",1
8151,The yellow-faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. ,0
8152,"These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.  ",1
8153,"The yellow-faced honeyeater is usually seen singly, in pairs or in small family groups, when not migrating.  ",1
8154,"They forage as individuals, as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds, and during migration in larger groups. ",0
8155,"They sometimes feed in large, mixed-species, foraging flocks, composed predominately of insectivorous birds.  ",1
8156,"Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater is thought to have adapted to a mixed diet.  ",1
8157,"Its diet consists of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. ",0
8158,"It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree-trunk, and rarely on the ground.  ",1
8159,"Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time.  ",1
8160,"The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, sallying, catching in flight, or probing in bark crevices. ",0
8161,"The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles, and spiders.  ",1
8162,"A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and green spider-flower (Grevillea mucronulata). ",0
8163,"In April and May, before the autumn migration, the yellow-faced honeyeater increases its nectar consumption, which increases its body mass. ",0
8164,"The average body mass in late autumn of 17.5 grams (0.62 oz) is 13% higher than the average recorded between January and April, and the yellow-faced honeyeater begins the migration with healthy fat reserves.  ",1
8165,"The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a breeding season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds.  ",1
8166,"They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics and other species including thornbills, spinebills and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female.  Within a breeding season, females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. ",1
8167,Banded birds have been identified in the same territory for periods of up to five years.  ,1
8168,"The nest is built in the understorey shrubs, relatively close to the ground. ",0
8169,"Nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma (Coprosma quadrifida), Cassinia, tea-trees (Melaleuca), eucalypts and acacias, as well as in garden shrubs.  ",1
8170,"The nest is a fragile, cup-shaped structure, swollen at the sides and narrower at the rim. ",0
8171,"The female builds the nest, but is often accompanied by the male as she gathers nesting material. ",0
8172,"Most nests are built of greenish material, which varies with the location; in coastal areas, grass is the primary material; in mountain forests, the nest is often covered with moss.  ",1
8173,One bird was recorded repeatedly flying between the nest and a koala 36 metres (118 ft) away and plucking the long hair near its ears to incorporate in the nest.   ,1
8174,"The nests are very fine, with the eggs visible through the gauze-like walls, and they sometimes fall apart. ",0
8175,They have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings falling through the bottom.  ,1
8176,"] Eggs are oval, approximately 21 millimetres (0.83 in) long and 14 millimetres (0.55 in) wide, and pinkish white in colour with spots and blotches of dark reddish-brown.  ",1
8177,"The clutch size varies from one to three eggs, and eggs take around two weeks to hatch. ",0
8178,"Upon hatching, both parents feed the nestlings and remove faecal pellets. ",0
8179,"The chicks fledge after thirteen days, and leave the parental territory after a further two weeks. ",0
8180,"The success rate can be as low as 16% of eggs developing into fledged young, with nest failure, hot weather, heavy rain, human activity (including fungicide spraying and nest damage), egg destruction by brood parasites, and predation by brown snakes, cats, and currawongs, all recorded as contributing to brood failure.  ",1
8181,"Among the species that parasitize the nests of yellow-faced honeyeaters are fan-tailed cuckoos, brush cuckoos, pallid cuckoos, shining bronze-cuckoos, and Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos.  ",1
8182,The yellow-faced honeyeater promptly nests again after both successful and failed breeding attempts.  ,1
8183,"A paternity analysis of yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity in the case of the remaining 44%. ",0
8184,"This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood-rearing, and to sexual monomorphism;  characteristics that are exhibited by the yellow honeyeater, for example. ",1
8185,"Several ectoparasites, which can affect survival and reproductive fitness, have been found on the yellow-faced honeyeater: the mites, Ptilonyssus meliphagae and P. thymanzae, and Ixodes species ticks.  ",1
8186,"In general, honeyeaters require extensive corridors of mature trees along their migratory routes, and flowering woodlands for nesting, so they are vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing and weed infestation. ",0
8187,The woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community. ,0
8188,"As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation.  ",1
8189,A field experiment to determine whether yellow-faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found that nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper in the forest. ,0
8190,"However, the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants; experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no increase in the number of avian predators at the forest edge. ",0
8191,"The results of the field experiment did not support the ""ecological trap"" and ""predator influx"" theories, and contribute to a belief that fragmented habitats may not be as problematic as previously thought.  ",1
8192,"In some areas, the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens, where it damages fruit.[16 The yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) is a passerine bird in the bunting family that is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to New Zealand and Australia. ",0
8193,"Most European birds remain in the breeding range year-round, but the eastern subspecies is partially migratory, with much of the population wintering further south. ",0
8194,"The male yellowhammer has a bright yellow head, streaked brown back, chestnut rump, and yellow under parts. ",0
8195,"The yellowhammer is common in open areas with some shrubs or trees, and forms small flocks in winter. ",0
8196,"Its song has a rhythm like ""A little bit of bread and no cheese"". ",0
8197,"The song is very similar to that of its closest relative, the pine bunting, with which it interbreeds. ",0
8198,"Breeding commences mainly in April and May, with the female building a lined cup nest in a concealed location on or near the ground. ",0
8199,"The three to five eggs are patterned with a mesh of fine dark lines, giving rise to the old name for the bird of ""scribble lark"" or ""writing lark"". ",0
8200,"The female incubates the eggs for 12â14 days prior to hatching, and broods the altricial downy chicks until they fledge 11â13 days later. ",0
8201,Both adults feed the chick in the nest and raise two or three broods each year. ,0
8202,"The nest may be raided by rodents or corvids, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey. ",0
8203,"Yellowhammers feed on the ground, usually in flocks outside the breeding season. ",0
8204,"Their diet is mainly seeds, supplemented by invertebrates in the breeding season. ",0
8205,"Changes to agricultural practices have led to population declines in western Europe, but its large numbers and huge range mean that the yellowhammer is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ",0
8206,"This conspicuous yellow bird has inspired poems by Robert Burns and John Clare, and its characteristic song has influenced musical works by Beethoven and Messiaen. ",0
8207,Children's writer Enid Blyton helped to popularise the standard English representation of the song. ,0
8208,"The bird family Emberizidae contains around 300 seed-eating species, the majority of which are found in the Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than 40 members, is confined to the Old World.  Within its genus, the yellowhammer is most closely related to the pine bunting, with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. ",1
8209,The white-capped and cirl buntings are also near relatives of the species pair.  ,1
8210,"Where their ranges meet, the yellowhammer and pine bunting interbreed; the yellowhammer is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east.  ",1
8211,The yellowhammer was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae under its current scientific name.  ,1
8212,"Emberiza is derived from the Old German Embritz, a bunting,  and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird.  ",1
8213,"The English name is thought to have come from Ammer, another German word for a bunting, and was first recorded in 1553 as yelambre.  ",1
8214,"The yellowhammer is a large bunting, 16â16.5 cm (6.3â6.5 in) long, with a 23â29.5 cm (9.1â11.6 in) wingspan;  it weighs 20â36.5 g (0.71â1.29 oz).  ",1
8215,"The male of the nominate subspecies E. c. citrinella has a bright yellow head, heavily streaked brown back, rufous rump, yellow under parts, and white outer tail feathers.  ",1
8216,"The female is less brightly coloured, and more streaked on the crown, breast, and flanks. ",0
8217,"Both sexes are less strongly marked outside the breeding season, when the dark fringes on new feathers obscure the yellow plumage. ",0
8218,"The juvenile is much duller and less yellow than the adults, and often has a paler rump.  ",1
8219,"After breeding, adults have a complete moult, which takes at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. ",0
8220,"Juveniles have a partial moult not long after fledging, replacing the head, body, and some covert feathers.  Differences between the subspecies are small and geographically gradual. ",1
8221,"On average, the male of E. c. caliginosa  is slightly smaller and darker than the same sex of the nominate subspecies, and also has more streaking on its back, a greenish tint to the yellow of the head and more chestnut on the flanks. ",0
8222,"The male of the eastern form, E. c. erythrogenys, is paler and less streaked than E. c. citrinella. ",0
8223,"Its flanks, undertail and wing bars are usually whiter, and its crown and throat are brighter yellow.  ",1
8224,Distinguishing females of the three subspecies using plumage features is not usually possible.  ,1
8225,"Females and juveniles, especially of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump, and more uniform upperparts than that species.  ",1
8226,Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species.  ,1
8227,"Male hybrids with pine buntings are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, under parts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.  ",1
8228,"The song of the cock yellowhammer is a series of short notes, gradually increasing in volume and followed by one or two more protracted notes. ",0
8229,"It is often represented as ""A little bit of bread and no cheese"", and the full version can be confused with the almost identical song of the pine bunting. ",0
8230,"If the final notes are omitted, confusion with the cirl bunting is possible. ",0
8231,"Other vocalisations include a zit contact call, a see alarm, and a trilled tirrr given in flight.  ",1
8232,"Yellowhammer males learn their songs from their fathers, and over time, regional dialects have developed,   with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas.  ",1
8233,"Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect;  females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.  ",1
8234,The pine bunting and yellowhammer are so closely related that each responds to the other's song. ,0
8235,"The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and is one reason for the dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.  ",1
8236,"It is the commonest and most widespread European bunting,  although it is absent from high mountains, Arctic regions, the western Netherlands, most of Iberia and Greece, and low-lying regions of other countries adjoining the Mediterranean Sea. ",1
8237,"It breeds in Russia east to Irkutsk, and in most of Ukraine. ",0
8238,"The Asian range extends into northwest Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Kazakhstan.  ",1
8239,"Most European yellowhammers winter within their breeding range, only the far north being vacated, although some birds move south of their breeding range in Spain, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries.  ",1
8240,Distances travelled can be up to 500 km (310 mi) for northern birds.  ,1
8241,"Asian birds are more strongly migratory, deserting much of the north to winter in Iraq, Iran, and southern Central Asia. ",0
8242,"The yellowhammer has occurred as a vagrant in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,  ",1
8243,"Kuwait, Morocco, Malta, the Himalayas (winter vagrant from northern Afghanistan to central Nepal ), the Balearic Islands, Iceland, and the Faroes.  Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa, were introduced to New Zealand by local acclimatisation societies in 1862,   and soon spread over the main islands. ",1
8244,"They sometimes visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island on a number of occasions. ",0
8245,"At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.[20 ",0
8246,] Populations of yellowhammer have also been introduced to the Falkland Islands and South Africa.  ,1
8247,"The yellowhammer is a bird of dry, open country, preferably with a range of vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. ",0
8248,"Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.  ",1
8249,"Breeding normally starts in early May, but often in April in the south of the range. ",0
8250,"The males establish territories along hedges or woodland fringes and sing from a tree or bush, often continuing well into July or August. ",0
8251,The male displays to the female by raising his wings and running towards her.  ,1
8252,"The nest is built by the female on or near the ground, and is typically well hidden in tussocks, against a bank or low in a bush. ",0
8253,"It is constructed from nearby plant material, such as leaves, dry grass, and stalks, and is lined with fine grasses and sometimes animal hair.  ",1
8254,It is 11.5â13 cm (4.5â5.1 in) across with a cup 4â4.5 cm (1.6â1.8 in) deep.  ,1
8255,"The clutch is usually three to five whitish eggs, typically patterned with a network of fine, dark lines. ",0
8256,"The eggs average 21 mm Ã 16 mm (0.83 in Ã 0.63 in) in size and weigh 2.9 g (0.10 oz), of which 6% is shell.  ",1
8257,"The female incubates the eggs for 12â14 days to hatching, and broods the altricial, downy chicks until they fledge 11â13 days later. ",0
8258,Both adults feed the chick in the nest and two or three broods are raised each year.   ,1
8259,"The adult annual survival rate in the UK is around 54%, and that for juveniles in their first year is 53%. ",0
8260,"The typical lifespan is three years,  although records from Great Britain and Germany indicate birds surviving more than 13 years.  ",1
8261,"Foraging is mainly on the ground, and the bird's diet consists mainly of seeds. ",0
8262,"Oily seeds, such as those of brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. ",0
8263,"Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed, and yarrow. ",0
8264,"Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up a significant part of the food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. ",0
8265,"When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks that can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.  ",1
8266,"The yellowhammer adds invertebrates to its diet in the breeding season, particularly as food for its growing chicks. ",0
8267,"A wide range of species is taken, including springtails, grasshoppers, flies, beetles, caterpillars, earthworms, spiders, and snails.[3During the first few days, chicks are exclusively fed invertebrate prey, but from day three they are also fed cereal grains, which the chicks can digest efficiently. ",0
8268,This is thought to be intentional by the parents to allow the nestlings to adjust their physiology to eating seed.[24 ,0
8269,"] Predators of the yellowhammer include the sparrowhawk,  northern goshawk,  lesser spotted eagle, and hobby.   ",1
8270,"It is not a significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite,  although as a ground-nesting bird, its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. ",1
8271,"Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays, and Eurasian magpies. ",0
8272,Predation accounted for more than 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.   ,1
8273,"Thirteen species of fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus have been found on this bunting,  and internal parasites include Ascaridia galli.  ",1
8274,The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. ,0
8275,"Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and tend to be less brightly coloured. ",0
8276,The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed.  ,1
8277,Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.  ,1
8278,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates the European population of the yellowhammer to be from 54â93 million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73â186 million birds. ",0
8279,"Although the population appears to be in a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger their vulnerability criteria. ",0
8280,"The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9 million km2 (5 million sq mi),  mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.  ",1
8281,"Populations have declined in recent decades in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, and Italy.  ",1
8282,The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK.   ,1
8283,"In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. ",0
8284,Changes to agricultural practices are thought to be responsible for reduced breeding densities.  ,1
8285,"The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.   ",1
8286,"The yellowhammer is a conspicuous, vocal, and formerly common country bird, and has attracted human interest. ",0
8287,"Yellowham Wood and Yellowham Hill, near Dorchester, both derive their names from the bird. ",0
8288,"Robbie Burns' poem ""The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin'"" gets its title from a Scottish name for the yellowhammer, which is given an obvious sexual connotation: ""I met a pretty maid, an' unto her ",0
8289,"More factual descriptions of the bird and its behaviour can be found in John Clare's ""The Yellowhammer's Nest"" and ""The Yellowhammer"", whose final lines read:   ",1
8290,"In early spring, when winds blow chilly cold,The yellowhammer, trailing grass, will comeTo fix a place and choose an early home,With yellow breast and head of solid gold. ",0
8291,"Enid Blyton helped to popularise the bird's song as ""little bit of bread and no cheese"" in books such as The Ship of Adventure and Five Go Off in a Caravan, and wrote a poem called ""The Yellow-hammer"".   Beethoven's student, Carl Czerny, and biographer Anton Schindler, both suggested that the composer got the idea for the first four notes of his 5th symphony from the yellowhammer's call, although  more likely the opening of the 4th Piano Concerto was actually the work in question.   ",1
8292,"Beethoven also used the yellowhammer theme in two piano sonatas, no. 21 in C major (the ""Waldstein"", Op.53) and No. 23 in F minor (the ""Appassionata"", Op.57).  ",1

8298,It has a short crest on the top of its head. ,0
8299,Its plumage is mostly brownish black and it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band. ,0
8300,The body feathers are edged with yellow giving a scalloped appearance. ,0
8301,"The adult male has a black beak and pinkish-red eye-rings, and the female has a bone-coloured beak and grey eye-rings. ",0
8302,"In flight, yellow-tailed black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly, with a peculiar heavy fluid motion. ",0
8303,The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found in forested regions from south and central eastern Queensland to southeastern South Australia including a very small population persisting in the Eyre Peninsula. ,0
8304,"Two subspecies are recognised, although Tasmanian and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies xanthanotus may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three. ",0
8305,"Birds of subspecies funereus (Queensland to eastern Victoria) have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall, while those of xanthanotus (western Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania) have more prominent scalloping. ",0
8306,"Unlike other cockatoos, a large proportion of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of wood-boring grubs; they also eat seeds. ",0
8307,"They nest in hollows high in trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. ",0
8308,"Although they remain common throughout much of their range, fragmentation of habitat and loss of large trees suitable for nesting has caused population decline in Victoria and South Australia. ",0
8309,"In some places yellow-tailed black cockatoos appear to have partially adapted to recent human alteration of landscape and they can often be seen in parts of urban Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. ",0
8310,"The species is not commonly seen in aviculture, especially outside Australia. ",0
8311,"Like most parrots, it is protected by CITES, an international agreement that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal. ",0
8312,"The yellow-tailed black cockatoo was first described in 1794 by the English naturalist George Shaw as Psittacus funereus, its specific name funereus relating to its dark and sombre plumage, as if dressed for a funeral.  ",1
8313,GaeÌtan Desmarest reclassified it in the new genus Calyptorhynchus in 1826.  ,1

8317,"Within the genus, the yellow-tailed and the two Western Australian white-tailed species, the short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos, form the genus Zanda. ",0
8318,"The red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos form the other genus, Calyptorhynchus. ",0
8319,"The two groups are distinguished by their juvenile food begging calls and the degree of sexual dimorphism: males and females of the latter group have markedly different plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.  ",1
8320,"The three species of the genus Zanda have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. ",0
8321,"In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race xanthanota of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species, with the long-billed as a distinct species. ",0
8322,"He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo.  ",1
8323,"However, an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to the yellow-tailed,  and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.  ",1
8324,"Within the species, two subspecies are recognised: The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is 55â65 cm (22â26 in) in length and 750â900 grams in weight.  ",1
8325,"It has a short mobile crest on the top of its head, and the plumage is mostly brownish-black with paler feather-margins in the neck, nape, and wings, and pale yellow bands in the tail feathers.  The tails of birds of subspecies funereus measure around 33 cm (13 in), with an average tail length 5 cm (2.0 in) longer than xanthanotus. ",1
8326,Male funereus birds weigh on average around 731 g (1.612 lb) and females weigh about 800 g (1.8 lb).[14 ,0
8327,"] Birds of the xanthanotus race on the mainland average heavier than the Tasmanian birds; the males on the mainland weigh on average around 630 g and females 637 g (1.404 lb), while those on Tasmania average 583 and 585 g (1.290 lb ",0
8328,Both mainland and Tasmanian birds of the xanthanotus race average about 28 cm (11 in) in tail length.  ,1
8329,"The plumage is a more solid brown-black in the eastern subspecies,  while the southern race has more pronounced yellow scalloping on the underparts.   ",1
8330,"The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo has a black bill, a dull yellow patch behind each eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. ",0
8331,"The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches.  ",1
8332,"Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings;   ",1
8333,"The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by two years of age, commencing at the base of the bill and spreading over ten weeks. ",0
8334,"The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla (upper beak), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks.  Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age.  ",1
8335,Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. ,0
8336,"He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males.  Moulting appears to take place in stages over the course of a year, and is poorly understood.  ",1
8337,"The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is distinguished from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call.  Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo.  ",1
8338,"Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.  ",1
8339,"An all-yellow bird lacking black pigment was recorded in Wauchope, New South Wales, in December 1996, and it remained part of the local group of cockatoos for four years. ",0
8340,Birds with part-yellow plumage have been recorded from different areas in Victoria.  ,1
8341,"The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level over southeastern Australia including the island of Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait (King, Flinders, Cape Barren islands), and also on Kangaroo Island.  ",1
8342,On Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait it is the only native black-coloured cockatoo.  ,1
8343,"On the mainland, it is found from the vicinity of Gin Gin and Gympie in south and central eastern Queensland, south through New South Wales, where it occurs along the Great Dividing Range and to the coast, and into and across most of Victoria bar the northern and northwestern corner, to the Coorong and Mount Lofty Ranges in southeastern South Australia.  ",1
8344,A tiny population numbering 30 to 40 birds inhabits the Eyre Peninsula. ,0
8345,There they are found in sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) woodland in the lower peninsula and migrate to the mallee areas in the northern peninsula after breeding.  ,1
8346,There is evidence that birds on the New South Wales south coast move from elevated areas to lower lying areas towards the coast in winter. ,0
8347,"They are generally common or locally very common in a wide range of habits, although they tend to be locally rare at the limits of their range.  ",1
8348,Their breeding range is restricted to areas with large old trees.  ,1
8349,"The birds may be found in a variety of habitats including grassy woodland, riparian forest, heathland, subalpine areas, pine plantations, and occasionally in urban areas, as long as there is a plentiful food supply.  ",1
8350,"They have also spread to parts of suburban Sydney, particularly on or near golf courses, pine plantations and parks,  such as Centennial Park in the eastern suburbs.  ",1
8351,It is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere.  ,1
8352,"In urban Melbourne, they have been recorded at Yarra Bend Park.  ",1
8353,"The ""Black Saturday bushfires"" of 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat for them to have been sighted in other parts of the urban areas of Melbourne as well. ",0
8354,"Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often heard before being seen.  ",1
8355,"They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other, and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs, or trios comprising a pair and their young, or small groups.   ",1
8356,"Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more, while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained.  ",1
8357,"They are generally wary birds, although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas.  ",1
8358,"They generally keep to trees, only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or Banksia cones or to drink. ",0
8359,"Flight is fluid and has been described as ""lazy"", with deep, slow wingbeats.  ",1
8360,Tall eucalypts that are emergent over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. ,0
8361,"It is here that the cockatoos rest for the night,  and also rest to shelter from the heat of the day.  ",1
8362,"They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. ",0
8363,"The usual call is a high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow ... kee-ow ... ",0
8364,"They also make a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae.  Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls.  ",1
8365,The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.  ,1
8366,"The breeding season varies according to latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.  ",1
8367,The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up his crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. ,0
8368,"Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows to her three or four times.  ",1
8369,"His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink.  Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which may be living or dead.  Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. ",1
8370,A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. ,0
8371,"The authors noted that the proposed 80â150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.  Hollows can be 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) deep and 0.25â0.5 metres (9.8â19.7 in) wide, with a base of woodchips.  ",1
8372,"A chance felling of a eucalypt known to have been used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring 56 cm (22 in) high by 30 cm (12 in) wide at the mouth, and at least 65 cm (26 in) deep, in a tree which measured 72 cm (28 in) in diameter below the hollow.

8373,"Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding,  which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. ",1
8374,The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. ,0
8375,The first egg averages around 47 or 48 mm long and 37 mm in diameter (2 Ã 1.4 in). ,0
8376,The second egg is around 2 mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. ,0
8377,The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. ,0
8378,"She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day.  ",1
8379,"The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy.  Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28â31 days.  ",1
8380,Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging.   ,1
8381,"Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching,  and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.  ",1
8382,"A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding when they were 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding.  ",1
8383,Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.  ,1
8384,"The diet of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat.  ",1
8385,"Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (Allocasuarina and Casuarina, including A. torulosa and A. verticillata), but also Eucalyptus (including E. maculata flowers and E. nitida seeds), Acacia (including gum exudate and galls), Banksia (including the green seed pods and seeds of B. serrata, B. integrifolia, and B. marginata), and Hakea species (including H. gibbosa, H. rugosa, H. nodosa, H. sericea, H. cycloptera, and H. dactyloides). ",0
8386,"They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata and to other introduced trees, including Cupressus torulosa, Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species.   ",1
8387,"In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), alongside native species.  ",1
8388,"The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is very fond of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali.   ",1
8389,"Birds seek them all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. ",0
8390,They search out holes and make exploratory bites looking for larvae. ,0
8391,"If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.  ",1
8392,A yellow-tailed black cockatoo was observed stripping 4 cm Ã 2 cm (1.57 in Ã 0.79 in) pieces of bark off the trunk of a dead Leptospermum tree in Acacia melanoxylon swamp near Togari in northwestern Tasmania. ,0
8393,It then scraped a layer of white material about 0.5 mm thick from the inner surface with its beak. ,0
8394,This white layer turned out to be hyphomycete fungi and slime mould that grew in the cambium of the bark.  Yellow-tailed black cockatoos have been reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. ,1
8395,"With pine trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. ",0
8396,"They drink at various places, from stock troughs to puddles, and do so in the early morning or late in the afternoon. ",0
8397,Insect larvae and Fabaceae seeds are among food reported to have been fed to young.  ,1
8398,"In 2004, a captive yellow-tailed black cockatoo and two free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological symptoms were shown to be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. ",0
8399,"A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.  Yellow-tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and Eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood to extract moth larvae. ",1
8400,"In places with these gum plantations, the population of the larva of the cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali grows, which then leads to increased predation (and hence tree damage) by cockatoos. ",0
8401,"Furthermore, plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees.  Yellow-tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s for this reason.  ",1
8402,The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region's bird. ,0
8403,Within the Jervis Bay area the birds can be seen feasting on the many Casuarina trees native to the area. ,0
8404,"Although it is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species,  and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. ",1
8405,"This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful in the vicinity of pine plantations.  ",1
8406,"It is listed as vulnerable in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges,  and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat.  ",1
8407,"Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity.  ",1
8408,"As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19â21 individuals in 1998.  ",1
8409,"This species was seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time a large number of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. ",0
8410,"Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. ",0
8411,Captive yellow-tailed black cockatoos require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health.  ,1
8412,"There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. ",0
8413,"They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding.  ",1
8414,"As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). ",0
8415,"In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz's Loro Parque zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam.  ",1
8416,"Like most species of parrot, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

8417,"The Zapata rail (Cyanolimnas cerverai) is a medium-sized, dark-coloured rail, the only member of the monotypic genus Cyanolimnas. ",0
8418,"It has brown upperparts, greyish-blue underparts, a red-based yellow bill, white undertail coverts, and red eyes and legs. ",0
8419,"It is endemic to the wetlands of the Zapata Peninsula in southern Cuba, where its only known nest was found in sawgrass tussocks. ",0
8420,"Little is known of its diet or reproductive behaviour, and its described calls may belong to a different species. ",0
8421,"The species was discovered by Spanish zoologist FermiÌn ZanoÌn Cervera in March 1927 in the Zapata Swamp near Santo TomaÌs, in the southern Matanzas Province of Cuba. ",0
8422,"The swamp holds one other bird found nowhere else, the Zapata wren, and also gives its name to the Zapata sparrow. ",0
8423,"Due to ongoing habitat loss in its limited range, its small population size, and predation by introduced mammals and catfish, the Zapata rail is evaluated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ",0
8424,"The Zapata rail was formally described by American herpetologist Thomas Barbour and his compatriot, ornithologist James Lee Peters, in 1927. ",0
8425,"They considered it distinctive enough to merit its own genus, Cyanolimnas.  ",1
8426,"The genus name derives from Ancient Greek kuanos ""dark blue"" and Modern Latin limnas ""rail or crake"";  the specific name cerverai honours the rail's discoverer, FermiÌn ZanoÌn Cervera, a Spanish soldier who had stayed on after the SpanishâAmerican War and became a professional naturalist.  ",1
8427,"Barbour had been accompanied by the Spaniard on his previous visits to Cuba, and on hearing of the strange birds to be found in the Zapata area, he sent Cervera on a series of trips into the region. ",0
8428,"Cervera eventually found the rail near the very small settlement which is commemorated in the Spanish name for the rail, ""Gallinuela de Santo TomaÌs"".   ",1
8429,"Cervera also discovered the Zapata wren and the Zapata sparrow,  and his name is commemorated by the new ecological centre in the CieÌnaga de Zapata National Park.  ",1
8430,"The rail family contains more than 150 species divided into at least 50 genera, the exact number depending on the authority. ",0
8431,"The Zapata rail is the only member of the genus Cyanolimnas, and is considered to be intermediate between two other New World genera, Mustelirallus and Pardirallus. ",0
8432,"All six species in the three genera are long-billed, five have drab plumage, and all but one have a red spot at the bill base. ",0
8433,"This is a medium-sized, dark rail, approximately 29 cm (11.4 in) long. ",0
8434,"The upperparts are olive-brown and the forehead, head sides and underparts are slate-grey, with some white barring on the lower belly. ",0
8435,"The iris, legs and feet are red, and the bill is yellow with a red base. ",0
8436,"The tail feathers are only sparsely barbed, and the wings are very short and rounded. ",0
8437,"The sexes are similar in appearance, but immature birds are duller and have olive feet and bill; the chicks, as with all rails, are covered with blackish down.    ",1
8438,"The Zapata rail's call is described as a bouncing cutucutu-cutucutu-cutucutu similar to that of the bare-legged owl,  and a loud limpkin-like kuvk kuck.  ",1
8439,"However, these calls may actually be those of the spotted rail.  ",1
8440,"There are no similar species in Cuba; the sympatric spotted rail is much the same size, but is heavily spotted and barred with white.  ",1
8441,"The Zapata rail's plumage is intermediate between those of the Colombian crake and the plumbeous rail, but these are mainland birds of Central and South America.  ",1
8442,"This rail is a Cuban endemic restricted to the northern part of the 4500 km2 (1740 mi2) Zapata Swamp, which is also the only location for the Zapata wren,  and the nominate subspecies of the Zapata sparrow.  ",1
8443,"The favoured habitat of the Zapata rail is flooded vegetation, 1.5â2.0 m (60â80 in) tall, consisting of tangled, bush-covered swamp and low trees, and preferably near higher ground. ",0
8444,"Typical plants of the swamp are wax myrtle, the willow Salix longipes, the sawgrass Cladium jamaicensis, and the narrow leaf cattail.  ",1
8445,"The species was once more widespread, with fossil bones found at Havana,  Pinar del RiÌo and the Isla de la Juventud.  ",1
8446,"Barbour did not believe that the rail, Zapata sparrow and Zapata wren were relics in the sense that they once ranged widely over Cuba (as did, for example, the dwarf hutia and the Cuban crocodile), since the birds are so highly modified for swamp conditions. ",0
8447,"He considered that conditions similar to those found today may once have extended over the large submerged area now represented by the shallow banks, with scattered mangrove keys, which stretch towards the Isla de la Juventud and perhaps eastward along the southern Cuban coast.  ",1
8448,"The birds fossilized at Isla de la Juventud are smaller than the single extant specimen, but the paucity of available material makes it impossible to establish whether the populations were genuinely different.  ",1
8449,"The Zapata rail usually breeds in Cladium jamaicensis sawgrass, building the nest above water-level on a raised tussock. ",0
8450,"Breeding occurs around September, and possibly also in December and January.  American ornithologist James Bond found a nest containing three white eggs 60 cm (2 ft) above water level in sawgrass, but little else is known of the breeding biology.   ",1
8451,"Rails are usually monogamous, and all have precocial chicks which are fed and guarded by the adults.  ",1
8452,"The diet is not recorded, but most marsh rails are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates and plant material. ",0
8453,"The rails may disperse in the rainy season, returning to permanently flooded areas in the dry months.   Like other rails, this species is difficult to observe as it moves through the sawgrass, and may crouch to avoid detection, but is not usually particularly wary. ",1
8454,"When disturbed, it may run a short distance and then stop with its tail raised and the conspicuous white undertail showing.  ",1
8455,"Despite its short wings, the Zapata rail may not be completely flightless.  ",1
8456,"On morphological grounds it would be classed as a flightless species, since the pectoral girdle and wing are as reduced as in other species of rails that are considered to be flightless, but Bond reported that he saw one flutter about ten feet across a canal.  Island species of rails are particularly vulnerable to population loss since they frequently and rapidly evolve to become flightless or very weak fliers,  and are very susceptible to introduced predators. ",1
8457,"Fifteen species have become extinct since 1600,  and more than 30 are endangered.  ",1
8458,"The species appears to have been easily found in the Santo TomaÌs area until 1931, but there were no further records until the 1970s when birds were found 65 km (40 mi) away at Laguna del Tesoro. ",0
8459,"The few records in subsequent years suggest that numbers remain low,  although after no official sightings for two decades, a 1998 survey found the birds at two new locations in the Zapata Swamp. ",1
8460,"Ten rails were detected at Peralta, and seven at Hato de Jicarita. ",0
8461,On the basis of this sample it was estimated that 70â90 rails were present in the 230 hectares (570 acres) between the two sites.  ,1
8462,"As of 2016, the only sighting for several years was in November 2014.  ",1
8463,"The Zapata rail is restricted to a single area, with an extent of about 1,000 km2 (400 mi2), and its small population, estimated on the basis of recent surveys and local assessments of population densities at 250â1,000 individuals, is assessed as decreasing. ",0
8464,"In the past, grass-cutting for roof thatch was a cause of extensive loss of breeding habitat, and habitat loss through dry-season burning of the vegetation continues. ",0
8465,"Predation by introduced small Asian mongooses and rats is a problem and, more recently, introduced African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) have been identified as major predators of rail chicks.    C. cerverai was classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List until 2011, when its status was uplisted to critically endangered.  ",1
8466,"This had already been suggested since, given the lack of knowledge about its calls, the rail's population may be lower than currently estimated.  Two remaining sites are in protected areas: the Corral de Santo TomaÌs Faunal Refuge, and the Laguna del Tesoro nature tourism area. ",1
8467,Surveys have recently been conducted throughout the species' range and proposed conservation measures include the control of dry season burning.  ,1
8468,"Cuba has plans to encourage more tourists, including to the Zapata area, and changes to United States policy mean that its citizens are allowed to visit Cuba. ",0
8469,"In the future, this could further increase the effects of ecotourism; this might have a dangerous impact on the wetland, but there are ways in which the impact of mass tourism can be mitigated.  ",1
8470,"In the longer term, the Ramsar-listed  swamp itself may be threatened. ",1
8471,"Rising sea levels due to global warming could contaminate the wetland with saltwater, damaging the plants and fauna, and by 2100 the area of CieÌnaga de Zapata would be reduced by one-fifth. ",0
8472,Higher ocean temperatures resulting from climate change could also lead to stronger hurricanes and drought. ,0
8473,"Bouza warned that the fallen vegetation left by hurricanes could act as fuel for further damaging fires once it had dried out.[29 Pterodroma mollis madeira Zino's petrel (Pterodroma madeira) or freira, is a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus which is endemic to the island of Madeira. ",0
8474,"This long-winged petrel has a grey back and wings, with a dark ""W"" marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. ",0
8475,"The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. ",0
8476,"It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger Fea's petrel, and separating these two Macaronesian species at sea is very challenging. ",0
8477,"Zino's was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to species status because of differences in morphology, calls, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA. ",0
8478,"It is Europe's most endangered seabird, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira. ",0
8479,"Zino's petrel nests in burrows which are visited only at night, to the accompaniment of their haunting calls. ",0
8480,"The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. ",0
8481,"Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. ",0
8482,"Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 65â80 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. ",0
8483,"However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks. ",0
8484,The gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. ,0
8485,"Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance have caused the taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid.  ",1
8486,"The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis,  and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds.  Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and ",1
8487,"Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species,  and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.  ",1
8488,"Nunn and Zino estimated that the two Macaronesian species diverged at the end of the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago.  ",1
8489,"An analysis of feather lice taken from Fea's petrels, Pterodroma feae deserti, from Bugio Island, and from Zino's petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. ",0
8490,"The species on Zino's petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea's petrel's lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific Pterodroma species. ",0
8491,"This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands.  ",1
8492,"Although their reproductive isolation has allowed the separate evolutionary development of the two species, genetic evidence shows the three Macaronesian petrels are each other's closest relatives.   ",1
8493,"The petrels breeding in the high central mountains of Madeira were first recorded in 1903 by German naturalist and priest Ernst Johann Schmitz, who failed to realise that they were different from the Fea's petrels he had seen in the Desertas. ",0
8494,The species was formally described as a race of soft-plumaged petrel by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1934.  ,1
8495,"Following the recognition of the Madeiran birds as a full species, they were named after the Portuguese ornithologist, Paul Alexander Zino, who was instrumental in their conservation during the latter half of the twentieth century. ",0
8496,"The genus name Pterodroma is derived from Greek ÏÏÎμÏÎ¿Î1⁄2, pteron, ""a wing"", and Î ́ÏÎ¿Î1⁄4Î¿Ï, dromos, ""running"", and refers to the bird's swift erratic flight.  ",1
8497,The specific madeira refers to the island on which it breeds. ,0
8498,"The Portuguese name Freira means ""nun""; the inhabitants of Curral das Freiras (Nun's Valley) near the breeding site claimed that the nocturnal wailing of the petrels in the breeding season were the calls of the suffering souls of the nuns. ",0
8499,The sisters had taken refuge in the valley from attacks on the island by French pirates in 1566 that lasted for 15 days.   ,1
8500,"They consist of a more abundant form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. ",0
8501,"It is uncertain whether they represent the site of a former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. ",0
8502,"They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.  ",1
8503,"This long-winged petrel is 32â34 cm (13â13 in) long with an 80â86 cm (31â34 in) wingspan,  and an average weight of 290 g (10.3 in).  ",1
8504,"It has a grey back, grey wings with a dark ""W"" marking across them, and a grey upper tail. ",0
8505,"The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. ",0
8506,"The head has a mottled whitish-brown forehead, a dark cap, and a dark spot below and behind the brown eye. ",0
8507,"The bill is black and the legs are flesh pink, the colour continuing onto the first third of the feet, the rest of the toes and webs being black-brown.  ",1
8508,"It gives the general impression of a small Cory's or great shearwater, with a fast flight; in strong winds it shears high above the surface with angled wings.  ",1
8509,"Nothing is known of the fresh juvenile plumage or the moult sequence, and ageing birds is currently not feasible.  ",1
8510,"This species is very similar in appearance to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. ",0
8511,"The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. ",0
8512,"Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but can be difficult to determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. ",0
8513,Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. ,0
8514,The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. ,0
8515,"Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. ",0
8516,"Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive.  ",1
8517,"Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.  ",1
8518,"This species at its breeding sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, and a much less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. ",0
8519,"The breeding calls are very similar to those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.  ",1
8520,"The Hadoram Shirihai expeditions to the Madeira archipelago in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a Pterodroma petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. ",0
8521,It may have been an unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. ,0
8522,"It may alternatively be a single aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. ",0
8523,"Zino's petrel is endemic to the main island of Madeira, where it breeds on inaccessible and well-vegetated ledges in the central mountains between Pico do Areeiro and Pico Ruivo. ",0
8524,"The typical ledge plants are endemic hemicryptophytess and Chamaephytes, but grasses may also be present.  ",1
8525,"It was formerly more widespread, since subfossil remains have been found in a cave in eastern Madeira, and on nearby Porto Santo Island. ",0
8526,The breeding ledges have to be inaccessible to introduced goats so that they remain rich in endemic flora. ,0
8527,"The vegetation ensures that there is sufficient earth on the ledges to allow the birds to burrow and make their nests, and trampling by grazing animals reduces the soil cover.  ",1
8528,This petrel is only present in Madeiran waters during the breeding season. ,0
8529,"Its distribution at sea during the rest of the year is poorly known due to the rarity of the species and the difficulty of separating it from other Pterodroma petrels at sea.    Birds identified as either Zino's or Fea's have been recorded from both sides of the North Atlantic, and in Ireland and Britain there has been a large increase in the number of reports, perhaps because global warming brings increasing numbers of tropical species into temperate waters. ",1
8530,"The timing of the reports, mainly in late spring and summer in the western North Atlantic, and in late summer and early autumn in the east, has suggested that birds follow a clockwise route around the North Atlantic after leaving their breeding sites. ",0
8531,"However, the few birds that have been identified with certainty have all been Fea's.  ",1
8532,"Zino's petrel may have a similar strategy, since preliminary results from geolocation studies indicate widespread dispersal over the North Atlantic central ridge during the breeding season, and migration towards the Brazilian coast in the non-breeding period. ",0
8533,"Pterodroma petrels have been recorded in the Canary Islands and the Azores on surprisingly few occasions;  a claim of possible Zino's from South Africa is now thought to be erroneous.  Zino's petrel breeds two months earlier than the Fea's petrel's on Bugio, only 50 km (31 mi) away. ",1
8534,The birds return from sea to their breeding grounds in late March or early April and courting occurs over the main breeding area during the late evening and early morning hours.  ,1
8535,The nest is a shallow burrow or old rabbit tunnel up to 140 cm (55 in) long in thick soil on vegetated ledges. ,0
8536,"The length of the burrow is related to the age of the pair that uses it, young birds making shorter tunnels, which are extended in subsequent years. ",0
8537,"The oval white egg is laid from mid-May to mid-June in a chamber at the end of the burrow and incubated for 51â54 days, each parent alternating between sitting on the nest and feeding at sea.   ",1
8538,The young fledge about 85 days later in late September and October. ,0
8539,This petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls. ,0
8540,"It stays 3â5 km (1.9â3.1 mi) offshore during the day, coming to land in darkness. ",0
8541,"It calls from about 30 minutes after nightfall until dawn, including on moonlit nights.  ",1
8542,"This species mates for life, and pairs return to the same burrow year after year. ",0
8543,"This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its burrow for ten consecutive years,  and the lifespan is estimated to be about 16 years.  ",1
8544,"The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be four or more years.  ",1
8545,"Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas,  and Zino's is not known to hybridise with any other species.  Zino's petrel, like its relatives, feeds on small squid and fish. ",1
8546,"The vomited stomach contents of one bird contained cephalopods, the bioluminiscent fish ",0
8547,"Their nocturnal approach to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. ",0
8548,"Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although there are a number of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks.  ",1
8549,"Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990.   ",1
8550,"Feather lice found on Zino's petrels include Trabeculus schillingi, Saemundssonia species and an unnamed species of Halipeurus.  Zino's petrel has a very restricted range on the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird.  ",1
8551,"The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, were thought to be extinct by the mid-twentieth century.  ",1
8552,"Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969.  ",1
8553,"In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. ",0
8554,"Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. ",0
8555,The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.  ,1
8556,There are now 130â160 known individuals (65â80 breeding pairs) confirmed to breed on just six ledges. ,0
8557,"There may be some disturbance from visitors at night and from the construction of a NATO radar station on the summit of Mount Areeiro, and in the longer term climate change may have an adverse effect, since all nests are within 1,000 m (3,300 ft) of the top of the highest mountain in the breeding area. ",0
8558,"Formerly, shepherds collected nestlings for food, and egg collectors have raided burrows. ",0
8559,"Currently, the main threats continue to be predation of eggs and chicks by rats, and of nesting adults by feral cats,  although at much reduced levels due to trapping.  Zino's petrel is protected under the EU's Wild Birds Directive, and its breeding sites lie within the Parque Natural da Madeira national park. ",1
8560,"Following the purchase of about 300 hectares (740 acres) of land around the main breeding site, all livestock has been removed from the breeding areas, allowing the vegetation to recover, although breeding still only occurs on ledges that were never accessible to grazing animals. ",0
8561,The research and predator control by the Freira Conservation Project and the national park which started in 1986 was expanded in 2001 with additional EU funding. ,0
8562,The increase in productivity (29 chicks fledged in 2004) meant that this species was downgraded from critically endangered to endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004.  ,1

",1
8567,"The first fossils of Achelousaurus were collected in Montana in 1987, by a team led by Jack Horner, with more finds made in 1989. ",0
8568,"In 1994, Achelousaurus horneri was described and named by Scott D. Sampson; the generic name means ""Achelous lizard"", in reference to the Greek god Achelous, and the specific name refers to Horner. ",0
8569,"The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults. ",0
8570,"A large centrosaurine, Achelousaurus supposedly was about 6 m (20 ft) long, with a weight of about 3 t (3.3 short tons). ",0
8571,"As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. ",0
8572,"It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. ",0
8573,Adult Achelousaurus had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. ,0
8574,"These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. ",0
8575,"Some researchers hypothesize that the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, as well as for display. ",0
8576,"Within the Ceratopsia, Achelousaurus lies within the clade Pachyrostra (or ""thick-snouts""). ",0
8577,It has been suggested that it was the direct descendant of the similar genus Einiosaurus (which had spikes but no bosses) and the direct ancestor of Pachyrhinosaurus (which had larger bosses). ,0
8578,"The first two genera would be transitional forms, evolving through anagenesis from Styracosaurus. ",0
8579,"There has been debate about this theory, with later discoveries showing that Achelousaurus is closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus in the group Pachyrhinosaurini. ",0
8580,Achelousaurus is known from the Two Medicine Formation and lived in the island continent of Laramidia. ,0
8581,"As a ceratopsian, Achelousaurus would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high metabolic rate, though lower than that of modern mammals and birds. ",0
8582,"All known Achelousaurus specimens were recovered from the Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana during excavations conducted by the Museum of the Rockies, which still houses the specimens. ",0
8583,"In the spring of 1985, paleontologist John ""Jack"" R. Horner was informed that he would no longer be allowed to exploit the Willow Creek site, where he had studied the Maiasaura Egg Mountain nesting colony for six years.  ",1
8584,"Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site. ",0
8585,"Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of Charles Whitney Gilmore who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them.  ",1
8586,"In this locality, Gilmore had employed George Fryer Sternberg to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs Brachyceratops and Styracosaurus ovatus.  ",1
8587,"That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, which is part of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation; it was the first paleontological investigation there since the 1920s. ",0
8588,"In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs.  ",1
8589,"On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry,  which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named Einiosaurus. ",1
8590,"In August 1986, at a nearby site â the Canyon Bone Bed on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the Milk River â Horner's team discovered another Einiosaurus bone bed. ",0
8591,"Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) Rubeosaurus, the genus name in 2010 given to Styracosaurus ovatus.   During the field season of 1987 (early July), volunteer Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485.  ",1
8592,"By the end of August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.  ",1
8593,"On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity â the Blacktail Creek North.  ",1
8594,"In the summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D. Sampson joined the team, wanting to study the function of the frill display structures in horned dinosaurs.  ",1
8595,"At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek.  ",1
8596,"It was initially assumed that all the horned dinosaur material recovered by the expeditions could be assigned to a single ""styracosaur"" species distinct from Styracosaurus albertensis, as the fossils represented a limited geological time period, then estimated at about half a million years.  Raymond Robert Rogers, who was studying the stratigraphy of the bone beds, referred to it as a Styracosaurus sp. ",1
8597,(of undetermined species) in 1989.  Styracosaurus ovatus â though sometimes considered an invalid nomen dubium  â had already been found in the area by G. F. Sternberg and was an obvious candidate.  ,1
8598,But also the possibility was taken into account that the finds were of a species new to science. ,0
8599,"This species was informally named ""Styracosaurus makeli"" in honor of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident just days before the discovery of specimen MOR 485.  ",1
8600,"In 1990, this name, as an invalid nomen nudum,  appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas.  Horner, an expert on the Hadrosauridae family, had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs.  ",1
8601,"In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds.  ",1
8602,"In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis.  ",1
8603,"Meanwhile, Horner had come to a more complex view of the situation. ",0
8604,He still thought that the fossil material had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa. ,0
8605,"In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio, and Mark Goodwin published an article in Nature based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. ",0
8606,"They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three ""transitional taxa"" spanning the gap between the already known Styracosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. ",0
8607,"The oldest form was indicated as ""Transitional Taxon A,"" mainly represented by skull MOR 492. ",0
8608,"Then came ""Taxon B"" â the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. ",0
8609,"The youngest was ""Taxon C,"" represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek.   ",1
8610,"In 1994, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he named ""Taxon C"" as a new genus and species, Achelousaurus horneri. ",0
8611,"Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, it did not identify a holotype, a name-bearing specimen.  ",1
8612,"In 1995, in a subsequent article, Sampson indicated specimen MOR 485 as the holotype specimen of Achelousaurus horneri. ",0
8613,"The generic name consists of the words Achelous, the name of a Greek mythological figure, and saurus, which is Latinized Greek for lizard. ",0
8614,Achelous (ÎÌÏÎμÎ»ÏÍÍÎ¿Ï) is a Greek river deity and a shapeshifter who was able to transform himself into anything. ,0
8615,"During a fight with Hercules, the mythical hero, Achelous took the form of a bull, but lost the battle when one of his horns was removed. ",0
8616,"This allusion is a reference to the supposedly transitional traits of the dinosaur and the characteristic loss of horns through ontogenetic and phylogenetic development, and thus through individual change and evolution.[22 ",0
8617,"] Dodson, in 1996, praised the generic name for being original and intelligent.  ",1
8618,"The specific name honors Jack Horner, for his research on the dinosaurs of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. ",0
8619,"Sampson also named ""Taxon B"" as the genus Einiosaurus in the same article wherein Achelousaurus was described. ",0
8620,"He said paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation (i.e., variation within a species) might be mistaken for interspecific differences (between species). ",0
8621,"Until 1995, only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since Pachyrhinosaurus in 1950, namely Avaceratops in 1986.  ",1
8622,Achelousaurus thus holds particular importance for being one of the few ceratopsid genera named in the late twentieth century.  ,1
8623,The holotype specimen MOR 485 was collected by Hostetter and Ray Rogers  from the Landslide Butte Field Area about 40 km (25 mi) northwest of Cut Bank. ,1
8624,"In 1995 Sampson described it as the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones.  ",1
8625,"Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone.  ",1
8626,"In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported that as part of the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4.  ",1
8627,"A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010.  ",1
8628,"Two other specimens were collected on the Blacktail Creek, 35 km (22 mi) to the south of Cut Bank and referred to Achelousaurus by Sampson in 1995. ",0
8629,"Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur.  ",1
8630,"Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, lacking only the braincase and occipital region.  ",1
8631,MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull base length of about 60 cm (24 in).  ,1
8632,Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult.  ,1
8633,"The skull consists of only the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars.  ",1
8634,"According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the Achelousaurus finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.  ",1
8635,"In addition to fossils that have been unequivocally assigned to Achelousaurus, some other material has been found of which the identity is uncertain. ",0
8636,"A centrosaurine ceratopsid specimen with bosses from the Dinosaur Park Formation (specimen TMP 2002.76.1) found in 1996 was suggested to belong to a new taxon in 2006, but may instead belong to Achelousaurus or Pachyrhinosaurus. ",0
8637,"Since it is missing the parietal bones, which are used to diagnose centrosaurines, it is not possible to assign it to any genus with confidence.   ",1
8638,"In 2006, it was also proposed that Monoclonius lowei, a dubious species based on a skull (specimen CMN 8790) from the Dinosaur Park Formation, could be a sub-adult specimen of Styracosaurus, Achelousaurus or Einiosaurus, with which it is roughly contemporaneous.  ",1
8639,"In addition, some indeterminate specimens from the Two Medicine Formation â such as fragmentary skull MOR 464  or snout MOR 449 â may belong to Achelousaurus or the two other roughly contemporary ceratopsids Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus.[8 ",1
8640,] Achelousaurus is estimated to have been 6 m (20 ft) long with a weight of 3 t (3.3 short tons).  ,1
8641,The skull of an adult individual (holotype specimen MOR 485) was estimated to have been 1.62 m (5.3 ft) long. ,0
8642,This puts it in the same size-range as other members of the Centrosaurinae subgroup of ceratopsians that lived during the Campanian age. ,0
8643,"It was about as large as its close relative Einiosaurus, but with a much heavier build.  ",1
8644,Achelousaurus approached the robustness of one of the largest and most heavily built horned dinosaurs known â Triceratops.  ,1
8645,"As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus would have been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, downwards swept tail. ",0
8646,"Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings, and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth.   ",1
8647,"In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. ",0
8648,Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).  ,1
8649,"In 1995, when describing the species, Sampson gave a formal list of four traits that distinguish Achelousaurus from its centrosaurine relatives. ",0
8650,"Firstly, adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that is relatively small and thin, and heavily covered with pits; secondly, adult individuals do not have true horns above the eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges; thirdly, not yet fully grown individuals, or subadults, have true horncores (the bony part of the horns) above the eye sockets with the inward facing surface being concave; and fourthly, the parietal bones of the neck shield have a single pair of curved spikes sticking out from the rear margin to behind and to the outside.  ",1
8651,"Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson pointed out additional differences with two very closely related forms. ",0
8652,"The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less directed to the outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. ",0
8653,Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. ,0
8654,"Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from other members of the Centrosaurinae.  Horned dinosaurs mainly differ from each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the neck like a shield. ",1
8655,"Achelousaurus exhibited the build of derived (""advanced"") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. ",0
8656,"The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear.  ",1
8657,It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is convex from side to side and concave from front to rear.  ,1
8658,"Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on the snout or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn.  ",1
8659,"Such a boss is often called ""pachyostotic"", i.e. consisting of thickened bone.  ",1
8660,"But describing it as a thick ""boss"" can be misleading: in fact, it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus.  ",1
8661,The nasal boss covered about two-thirds of the top surface of the nasal bones.  ,1
8662,"The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high.  ",1
8663,"It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket.  ",1
8664,Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket.  ,1
8665,"The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) at the front of the snout,  though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla.  ",1
8666,The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. ,0
8667,"The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related Einiosaurus, until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in Pachyrhinosaurus.  ",1
8668,The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. ,0
8669,From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front.  ,1
8670,The snout was â compared to that of Einiosaurus â relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. ,0
8671,"The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.  ",1
8672,"Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region above the eyes, instead of the horns of other ceratopsids. ",0
8673,"The supraorbital bosses extended from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top.  ",1
8674,"The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss,  forming a distinctive transverse saddle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses.  ",1
8675,"This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses from each other and forming a T-shape in top view.  ",1
8676,"These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. ",0
8677,The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. ,0
8678,They had a concave surface on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.  ,1
8679,"The skull roof of Achelousaurus had a midline cavity, with an opening at the top called the frontal fontanelle, a feature found in all ceratopsids, which have a ""double"" skull roof formed by the frontal bones folding towards each other between the brow horn bases. ",0
8680,"This cavity formed sinuses that extended below the supraorbital bosses, which were therefore relatively thin internally, being 25 mm (1 in) thick from the outside to the cavity roof. ",0
8681,"This cavity appears to have partially closed over as an animal aged, with only the rear part of the fontanelle being open in the adult specimen MOR 485.  ",1
8682,"Like that of all other ceratopsids, the skull of Achelousaurus had a parietosquamosal frill or ""neck shield"", which was formed by the parietal bones at the rear and the squamosal bones at the sides. ",0
8683,"The parietal is one of the main bones used to distinguish centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them, whereas the squamosal is very similar across taxa.  ",1
8684,"In Achelousaurus, the squamosal bone was much shorter than the parietal. ",0
8685,"Of its inner margin the rear portion formed a step in relation to the front part, with the suture between the squamosal and the parietal showing a kink to behind at the level of the rear supratemporal fenestra, a typical centrosaurine trait.  ",1
8686,"The squamosal and the jugal bone, by touching each other, excluded the quadratojugal from the edge of the lateral temporal fenestra, i.e. the opening at the rear of the skull side.  ",1
8687,The frill of Achelousaurus had two conspicuous large spikes that were directed backwards and curved to the sides away from each other. ,0
8688,"During the 1990s, it was increasingly understood that such spikes on the parietals were not random growths but specific traits that could be used to determine the evolution of horned dinosaurs, if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species. ",0
8689,"Sampson, in the paper describing Achelousaurus in 1995, therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes, counting them from the midline to the side of the frill.  ",1
8690,This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997.  ,1
8691,"The large spikes of Achelousaurus correspond to ""Process 3"" spikes of other centrosaurines and were similar to those of Einiosaurus, though curved more to the sides, similar to Pachyrhinosaurus.  ",1
8692,They were shorter and thinner than the corresponding spikes of Styracosaurus.  ,1
8693,"Between these spikes, on both sides of the central frill notch, were two small tab-like processes (""Process 2"") that were directed towards the midline.  Innermost ""Process 1"" spikes, as present in Centrosaurus, are lacking with Achelousaurus.  ",1
8694,"The frill had two large paired openings, the parietal fenestrae, with a midline parietal bar between them. ",0
8695,"A linear row of rounded swellings ran along the top of the parietal bar, which may be homologous to the spikes and horns in the same area of some Pachyrhinosaurus specimens. ",0
8696,"A row of relatively small processes ran along the parietal shield margin from the ""Process 3"" spikes outwards,  for a total per side of seven. ",1
8697,"They were largely equal in size, causing the P4 process to be reduced in comparison to the P3.  ",1
8698,"These lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals, bones that lined the frills of ceratopsids.  ",1
8699,"In Achelousaurus these epoccipitals, which start as separate skin ossifications or osteoderms, fuse with the underlying frill bone to form spikes,  at least in the third position.  ",1
8700,"In 2020, it was denied that these processes were separate ossifications. ",0
8701,"In the most mature individuals, the front-most P6 and P7 processes would be less imbricated relative to each other, rotated around their longitudinal axes.  ",1
8702,"The bosses on the skull of Achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain.  ",1
8703,"In 2009, the paleontologist Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined the skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. ",0
8704,"They proposed that the rugose bosses of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). ",0
8705,The nasal horncore of adult Achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. ,0
8706,A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch at the tip of the nasal horncore. ,0
8707,The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. ,0
8708,"The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of Coronosaurus, as indicated by the orientation of the ""fins"" or ridges on the bosses. ",0
8709,That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. ,0
8710,The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. ,0
8711,"In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.  ",1
8712,"In 1992, the study by Horner et al. tried to account for the fact that within a limited geological period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. ",0
8713,"Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. ",0
8714,But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. ,0
8715,This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. ,0
8716,The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis. ,0
8717,"This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. ",0
8718,"A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies â unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. ",0
8719,The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters.  ,1
8720,"In the lowest layers of the Two Medicine Formation, 60 m (200 ft) below the overlaying Bearpaw Formation, ""Transitional Taxon A"" was present. ",0
8721,"It seemed to be identical to Styracosaurus albertensis, differing from it only in the possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes. ",0
8722,"The middle layers, 45 m (150 ft) below the Bearpaw, contained ""Transitional Taxon B"" that also had a single spike pair but differed in the form of its nasal horn that curved to the front over the anterior branches of the nasal bones. ",0
8723,"In the upper strata, 20 m (65 ft) below the Bearpaw, ""Transitional Taxon C"" had been excavated. ",0
8724,It too had a spike pair but now the nasal horn was fused with the front branches. ,0
8725,The upper surface of the horn was elevated and very rough. ,0
8726,"In 1992, Horner et al. did not name these as species for the explicit reason that the entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between Styracosaurus albertensis, known from the Judith River Formation, and the derived, hornless Pachyrhinosaurus from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which had the spike pair and bosses on the nose and above the eyes, as well as additional frill ornamentation.  ",1
8727,"In 1997, Horner referred to the three taxa as ""centrosaurine 1.,"" ""centrosaurine 2.,"" and ",0
8728,"""centrosaurine 3..a.  Horner thought he had found the mechanism driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte.  ",1
8729,"The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the 3 to 4 kilometres (2 to 2.5 mi) high proto-Rocky Mountains. ",0
8730,"During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about 300 km (200 mi) to 30 km (20 mi).  ",1
8731,"This led to stronger selection pressures,  the severest for Achelousaurus which lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest.  ",1
8732,"The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible.  ",1
8733,"Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses.  ",1
8734,"A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. ",0
8735,"That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. ",0
8736,"According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.  ",1
8737,Horner did not perform an exact cladistic analysis determining the relationship between the three populations. ,0
8738,Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. ,0
8739,He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. ,0
8740,"Such a tree would, as a consequence of the method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. ",0
8741,Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. ,0
8742,"Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. ",0
8743,"Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.  ",1
8744,"Basing himself on revised data, Sampson in 1995 estimated that the layers investigated represented a longer period of time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. ",0
8745,"He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. ",0
8746,"These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.  ",1
8747,"Firstly, the possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. ",0
8748,This suggested to him that the EiniosaurusâAchelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. ,0
8749,"Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. ",0
8750,"This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. ",0
8751,"But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.  ",1
8752,"In 2010, Horner admitted that specimen TMP 2002.76.1 seemed to indicate that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. ",0
8753,"But he stressed that even if the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. ",0
8754,"Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. ",0
8755,"Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.  ",1
8756,"The process of anagenesis was affirmed by John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. ",0
8757,"They compared a small Einiosaurus specimen, MOR 456 8-8-87-1, with Achelousaurus specimen MOR 591. ",0
8758,"Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR 456 8-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR 591. ",0
8759,They concluded that Achelousaurus was likely the direct descendant of Einiosaurus. ,0
8760,"The differences between the two taxa would have been caused by heterochrony â differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.  Since Wilson and colleagues found in 2020 that Stellasaurus (Horner's ""Taxon A"") was intermediate between Styracosaurus and Einiosaurus in morphology and stratigraphy, they could not discount that it was a transitional taxon within an anagenetic lineage.  ",1
8761,"In 1995, Sampson formally placed Achelousaurus in the Ceratopsidae, more precisely the Centrosaurinae.  ",1
8762,"In all analyses, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are part of the clade Pachyrhinosaurini. ",0
8763,"By definition, Achelousaurus is a member of the clade Pachyrostra (or ""thick-snouts""), in which it is united with Pachyrhinosaurus.  ",1
8764,"In 2010, Gregory S. Paul assigned A. horneri to the genus Centrosaurus, as C. horneri.  ",1
8765,"This has found no acceptance among other researchers, with subsequent taxonomic assessments invariably keeping the generic name ",0
8766,"Achelousaurus.     Sampson felt, in 1995, that there was not enough evidence to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. ",1
8767,"Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. ",0
8768,"This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. ",0
8769,"Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.  ",1
8770,"Subsequent studies have sought to determine the precise relationships within this part of the evolutionary tree, with conflicting results regarding the question whether Styracosaurus albertensis or Einiosaurus might have been in the direct line of ascent to Achelousaurus. ",0
8771,"In 2005, an analysis by Michael Ryan and Anthony Russell found Styracosaurus more closely related to Achelousaurus than to Centrosaurus.  ",1
8772,"The same year Horner and Andrew T. McDonald moved Styracosaurus ovatus to its own genus, Rubeosaurus, finding it a sister species of Einiosaurus, while Styracosaurus albertensis was again located on the Centrosaurus branch. ",0
8773,"They also assigned specimen MOR 492, the basis of ""Taxon A"", to Rubeosaurus.  ",1
8774,"In 2011, a subsequent study by Andrew T. McDonald in this respect replicated the outcome of his previous one,  as did a publication by Andre Farke et al.  ",1
8775,"In 2017, J.P. Wilson and Ryan further complicated the issue, concluding that MOR 492 (""Taxon A"") was not referable to Rubeosaurus and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it.  Wilson and colleagues moved MOR 492 to the new genus Stellasaurus in 2020, which therefore corresponds to ""Taxon A"". ",1
8776,"Their study found Rubeosaurus ovatus to be the sister species of Styracosaurus albertensis, and concluded Rubeosaurus to be synonymous with Styracosaurus.  ",1
8777,"Before Achelousaurus was described, Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis had been considered a solitary aberrant form among centrosaurines, set apart from them by its unusual bosses. ",0
8778,"Achelousaurus gave evolutionary context to the Canadian species, while expanding the temporal and geographical range for what came to be seen as ""pachyrhinosaurs. ",0
8779,"In that study, the term ""Pachyrhinosaurs"" was used for the clade consisting of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus.  ",1
8780,"When Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum was described in 2012, the clade name Pachyrostra was coined, uniting the two genera; Achelousaurus is the basalmost pachyrostran. ",0
8781,Shared derived traits (or synapomorphies) of the group are an enlarged nasal ornamentation and a change of the nasal and brow horns into bosses.  ,1
8782,"At the end of the Campanian, there seems to have been a trend of pachyrostrans replacing other centrosaurines.  ",1
8783,"Also in 2012, the clade Pachyrhinosaurini was named, consisting of species more closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus or Achelousaurus than to Centrosaurus. ",0
8784,"Apart from Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus, this included Sinoceratops and Xenoceratops, according to a 2013 study.  ",1
8785,"Their results can be shown in a cladogram, with the relationships found ordered in an evolutionary tree. ",0
8786,"The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of Achelousaurus in a cladogram from Wilson and colleagues, 2020.  ",1
8787,"In 1995, Sampson noted that earlier studies had found that the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a function in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating.  ",1
8788,"Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit.  ",1
8789,Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation.  ,1
8790,"Sampson in 1995 rejected the possibility that the difference in skull ornamentation between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. ",0
8791,"Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. ",0
8792,"Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. ",0
8793,"Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually, only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. ",0
8794,"Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a distinct set of such traits.  Hieronymus, in 2009, concluded that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. ",1
8795,"The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights similar to those of members of the Caprinae subfamily. ",0
8796,"In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. ",0
8797,"The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. ",0
8798,Opponents would have engaged this way only after assessing each other's strengths visually. ,0
8799,"For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real â instead of a ritual â fight. ",0
8800,"The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.  ",1
8801,"Previously it had been suggested that the fusion of the first three neck vertebrae, such as seen in the mature specimen MOR 571, might have been a paleopathology, an instance of the disease spondyloarthropathy, but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal ontogenetic trait, the vertebrae growing together to form a so-called ""syncervical"" to support the heavy head.  ",1
8802,All three main known specimens have syncervicals consisting of three fused neck vertebrae;   the trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition.  ,1
8803,"It has been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to the large number of known bone beds containing multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. ",0
8804,"In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians.  ",1
8805,Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds which had been killed by drought or disease.  ,1
8806,Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.  ,1
8807,"There has long been debate about the thermoregulation of dinosaurs, centered around whether they were ectotherms (""cold-blooded"") or endotherms (""warm-blooded""). ",0
8808,"Mammals and birds are homeothermic endotherms, which generate their own body heat and have a high metabolism, whereas reptiles are heterothermic ectotherms, which receive most of their body heat from their surroundings. ",0
8809,"A 1996 study examined the oxygen isotopes from bone phosphates of animals from the Two Medicine Formation, including the juvenile Achelousaurus specimen MOR 591. ",0
8810,"Î ́18O values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on the Î ́18O values in their body water and the temperature when the bones were deposited, making it possible to measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited. ",0
8811,"The study analyzed seasonal variations in the body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions, to determine whether the dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally. ",0
8812,A varanid lizard fossil sampled for the study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic ectotherm. ,0
8813,"The variation of the dinosaurs, including Achelousaurus, was consistent with them being homeothermic endotherms. ",0
8814,"The metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds, and they may have been intermediate endotherms.  ",1
8815,"Achelousaurus is known from the Two Medicine Formation, which preserves coastal sediments dating from the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 83 and 74 million years ago. ",0
8816,"Achelousaurus specimens are found in the highest levels of the formation, probably closer to the end of that timeframe, 74 million years ago.  ",1
8817,The Two Medicine Formation is typified by a warm semiarid climate. ,0
8818,Its layers were deposed on the east coast of the Laramidia island continent (which consisted of western North America). ,0
8819,"The high cordillera in the west, combined with predominantly western winds, would have caused a rain shadow, limiting annual rainfall. ",0
8820,"Rain would mainly have fallen during the summer, when convection storms flooded the landscape. ",0
8821,"The climate would thus also have been very seasonal, with a long dry season and a short wet season. ",0
8822,"In such conditions, horned dinosaurs would have been dependent on oxbow lakes for a continuous supply of water and food â the main river channels tending to run dry earlier â and perished in them during severe droughts when the animals concentrated around the last watering holes, causing bone beds to form.  ",1
8823,The brown paleosol in which the horned dinosaurs were found â a mixture of clay and coalified wood fragments â resembles that of modern seasonally dry swamps. ,0
8824,The surrounding vegetation might have consisted of about 25 m (80 ft) high conifer trees.  ,1
8825,"Achelousaurus ate much smaller plants, though: a 2013 study determined that ceratopsid herbivores on Laramidia were restricted to feeding on vegetation with a height of 1 m (3.5 ft) or lower.  More or less contemporary dinosaur genera of the area included Prosaurolophus, Scolosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Einiosaurus and tyrannosaurids of uncertain classification. ",1
8826,"As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large theropod predator, which Rogers suggested were Albertosaurus.  ",1
8827,"The exact composition of the fauna Achelousaurus was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. ",0
8828,Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that Achelousaurus shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or at the end of the time range of its formation. ,0
8829,"As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. ",0
8830,One of these was a form in between Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus;  in 1994 he would name it Hypacrosaurus ,1
8831,"Today, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified.  ",1
8832,Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between Stegoceras and Pachycephalosaurus;  these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. ,1
8833,"Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.  ",1
8834,"In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of Daspletosaurus: ",0
8835,"The 2017 study considered it plausible that D. horneri was a direct descendant of D. torosus in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that D. horneri was the ancestor of Tyrannosaurus.  ",1
8836,Other ceratopsians from the Two Medicine Formation include Einiosaurus and Stellasaurus. ,0
8837,"In addition, remains of other indeterminate and dubious centrosaurines, including Brachyceratops, are known from the formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this is not possible to demonstrate.   ",1
8838,"Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. ",0
8839,The skull of Achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of Einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance. ,0
8840,This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. ,0
8841,"The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5 newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2) at the maxillary tooth row and 18 N/mm2 at the beak.  Wilson and colleagues found that since the Two Medicine centrosaurines were separated stratigraphically, they were therefore possibly not contemporaneous.  ",1
8842,"The indeterminate specimen TMP 2002.76.1 is from the Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon.  Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known from more than one formation. ",1
8843,"Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP 2002.76.1 is about 500,000 years older than the Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.[35Acrocanthosaurus (/ËÃ¦kroÊËkÃ¦nÎ ̧ÉËsÉËrÉs/ ak-ro-KAN-thÉ-SAWR-És; meaning ""high-spined lizard"") is a genus of theropod dinosaur that existed in what is now North America during the Aptian and early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous. ",0
8844,"Like most dinosaur genera, Acrocanthosaurus contains only a single species, A. atokensis. ",0
8845,"Its fossil remains are found mainly in the U.S. states of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming, although teeth attributed to Acrocanthosaurus have been found as far east as Maryland, suggesting a continent wide range. ",0
8846,"As the name suggests, it is best known for the high neural spines on many of its vertebrae, which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal's neck, back, and hips.  ",1
8847,"Acrocanthosaurus was one of the largest theropods, reaching 11.5 meters (38 ft) in length, and weighing up to 6.2 metric tons (6.8 short tons).  ",1
8848,"Large theropod footprints discovered in Texas may have been made by Acrocanthosaurus, although there is no direct association with skeletal remains. ",0
8849,"Recent discoveries have elucidated many details of its anatomy, allowing for specialized studies focusing on its brain structure and forelimb function. ",0
8850,"Acrocanthosaurus was the largest theropod in its ecosystem and likely an apex predator which preyed on sauropods, ornithopods, and ankylosaurs. ",0
8851,"Acrocanthosaurus is named after its tall neural spines, from the Greek ÉÎoÏÉ/akra ('high'), ÉÎoÉÎ1⁄2Î ̧É/akantha ('thorn' or 'spine') and ÏÉÊÏÎ¿Ï/sauros (' lizard').  ",1
8852,"There is one named species (A. atokensis), which is named after Atoka County in Oklahoma, where the original specimens were found. ",0
8853,The name was coined in 1950 by American paleontologists J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr.[1 ,0
8854,"Langston had proposed the name ""Acracanthus atokaensis"" for the genus and species in his unpublished 1947 master's thesis,   but the name was changed to Acrocanthosaurus atokensis for formal publication. ",1
8855,"The holotype and paratype (OMNH 10146 and OMNH 10147), discovered in the early 1940s and described at the same time in 1950, consist of two partial skeletons and a piece of skull material from the Antlers Formation in Oklahoma.  ",1
8856,"The first (SMU 74646) is a partial skeleton, missing most of the skull, recovered from the Twin Mountains Formation of Texas and currently part of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History collection.  ",1
8857,"An even more complete skeleton (NCSM 14345, nicknamed ""Fran"") was recovered from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma by Cephis Hall and Sid Love, prepared by the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota, and is now housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. ",0
8858,This specimen is the largest and includes the only known complete skull and forelimb.  ,1
8859,"Skeletal elements of OMNH 10147 are almost the same size as comparable bones in NCSM 14345, indicating an animal of roughly the same size, while the holotype and SMU 74646 are significantly smaller.  ",1
8860,"The presence of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation was established in 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM 20796. ",0
8861,"This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. ",0
8862,"It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. ",0
8863,"An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, which may be the only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.  Acrocanthosaurus may be known from less complete remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. ",1
8864,"A tooth from southern Arizona has been referred to the genus,  and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area.  Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus.  ",1
8865,"Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified;  there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.  ",1
8866,"The largest known specimen (NCSM 14345) is estimated to have measured 11.5 m (38 ft)  from snout to tail tip and weighed 5.7 to 6.2 metric tons (6.3 to 6.8 short tons),   with an upper maximum weight of 7.25 metric tons (7.99 short tons) within the realm of possibility for this specimen.  ",1
8867,Its skull alone was nearly 1.3 m (4.3 ft) in length.  ,1
8868,"The skull of Acrocanthosaurus, like most other allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. ",0
8869,"The weight-reducing opening in front of the eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, more than a quarter of the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. ",0
8870,The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. ,0
8871,"Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they continued onto the lacrimal bones.  ",1
8872,"Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. ",0
8873,"The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. ",0
8874,"Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. ",0
8875,Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. ,0
8876,"The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. ",0
8877,"Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.  The most notable feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines, located on the vertebrae of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5 times the height of the vertebrae from which they extended.  ",1
8878,"Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. ",0
8879,"(6.6 ft) tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae.  ",1
8880,"The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back.  ",1
8881,"The function of the spines remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, muscle or temperature control. ",0
8882,"All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. ",0
8883,"Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail counterbalancing the head and body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. ",0
8884,Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. ,0
8885,"Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals,   suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner.  ",1
8886,"Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. ",0
8887,"Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was much smaller than the rest and did not make contact with the ground.   Acrocanthosaurus is classified in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. ",1
8888,"This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of the snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features.  ",1
8889,"It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus,  an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000.  Most studies have found it to be a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.    ",1
8890,"At the time of its discovery, Acrocanthosaurus and most other large theropods were known from only fragmentary remains, leading to highly variable classifications for this genus. ",0
8891,"J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. first assigned it to the ""Antrodemidae"", the equivalent of Allosauridae, but it was transferred to the taxonomic wastebasket Megalosauridae by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1956.  To other authors, the long spines on its vertebrae suggested a relationship with Spinosaurus.   ",1
8892,"This interpretation of Acrocanthosaurus as a spinosaurid persisted into the 1980s,  and was repeated in the semi-technical dinosaur books of the time.   ",1
8893,"Tall spined vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous of England were once considered to be very similar to those of Acrocanthosaurus,  and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, A. altispinax.  ",1
8894,"These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus.  ",1
8895,"These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax.[27 ",0
8896,"] Most cladistic analyses including  Acrocanthosaurus have found it to be a carcharodontosaurid, usually in a basal position relative to the African Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus from South America.    ",1
8897,"It has often been considered the sister taxon to the equally basal Eocarcharia, also from Africa. ",0
8898,"Neovenator, discovered in England, is often considered an even more basal carcharodontosaurid, or as a basal member of a sister group called Neovenatoridae.   ",1
8899,This suggests that the family originated in Europe and then dispersed into the southern continents (at the time united as the supercontinent Gondwana). ,0
8900,"If Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid, then dispersal would also have occurred into North America.  ",1
8901,"All known carcharodontosaurids lived during the early-to-middle Cretaceous Period. The following cladogram after Novas et al., 2013, shows the placement of Acrocanthosaurus within Carcharodontosauridae.  ",1
8902,"From the bone features of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, it is estimated that Acrocanthosaurus required at least 12 years to fully grow. ",0
8903,"This number may have been much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. ",0
8904,"If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needed 18â24 years to be mature.  Like those of most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not make contact with the ground and were not used for locomotion; instead, they served a predatory function. ",1
8905,The discovery of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus.  ,1
8906,The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. ,0
8907,"In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. ",0
8908,"Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backward slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards). The shoulder of Acrocanthosaurus was limited in its range of motion compared to that of humans. ",1
8909,"The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backward) 109Â° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. ",0
8910,Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24Â° past the vertical. ,0
8911,The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards) but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9Â° above horizontal. ,0
8912,"Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57Â°. ",0
8913,"The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. ",0
8914,The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.  ,1
8915,"None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit together precisely, suggesting the presence of a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. ",0
8916,All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backward) until they nearly touched the wrist. ,0
8917,"When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. ",0
8918,"The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. ",0
8919,"Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.  ",1
8920,"After determining the ranges of motion in the joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. ",0
8921,"The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. ",0
8922,"Therefore, they were not likely to have been used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. ",0
8923,"On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. ",0
8924,"Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. ",0
8925,"As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. ",0
8926,The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. ,0
8927,"Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. ",0
8928,"Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.  Other less probable theories have suggested the forelimb range of motion being able to grasp onto the side of a sauropod and clinging on to topple the sauropods of smaller stature, though this is unlikely due to Acrocanthosaurus having a rather robust leg structure compared to other similarly structured theropods. ",1
8929,"In 2005, scientists reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus cranial cavity using computed tomography (CT scanning) to analyze the spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). ",0
8930,"In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, in addition to the brain itself. ",0
8931,"However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. ",0
8932,"While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. ",0
8933,"It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.  ",1
8934,"The brain was slightly sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much expansion of the cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. ",0
8935,This is in keeping with the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. ,0
8936,"Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. ",0
8937,"Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25Â° angle below horizontal. ",0
8938,"This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.  ",1
8939,"The Glen Rose Formation of central Texas preserves many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. ",0
8940,"The most famous of these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City,  although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature.   ",1
8941,"It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones have been associated with the trackways. ",0
8942,"However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus.  ",1
8943,A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. ,0
8944,"However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. ",0
8945,"Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.  ",1
8946,The famous Glen Rose trackway on display in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved in the same direction as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. ,0
8947,"The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. ",0
8948,This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods.  ,1
8949,"While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. ",0
8950,"For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. ",0
8951,"The same can be said for the purported ""herd"" of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group.  ",1
8952,"At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack.  ",1
8953,"However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side.  ",1
8954,The skull of the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic material on the squamosal. ,0
8955,The neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.  ,1
8956,"Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils have been found in the Twin Mountains Formation of northern Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland. ",0
8957,"These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. ",0
8958,"Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. ",0
8959,"This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112 million years ago.  ",1
8960,"The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers.  ",1
8961,"Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.  ",1
8962,"During this time, the area preserved in the Twin Mountains and Antlers formations was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. ",0
8963,"A few million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous. ",0
8964,"The Glen Rose Formation represents a coastal environment, with possible Acrocanthosaurus tracks preserved in mudflats along the ancient shoreline. ",0
8965,"As Acrocanthosaurus was a large predator, it is expected that it had an extensive home range and lived in many different environments in the area.  ",1
8966,"Potential prey animals include sauropods like Astrodon  or possibly even the enormous Sauroposeidon,  as well as large ornithopods like Tenontosaurus.  ",1
8967,"The smaller theropod Deinonychus also prowled the area but at 3 m (10 ft) in length, most likely provided only minimal competition, or even food, for Acrocanthosaurus.[42      Albertosaurus (/Ã¦lËbÉËrtÉËsÉËrÉs/; meaning ""Alberta lizard"") is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70 million years ago. ",0
8968,"The type species, A. sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian province of Alberta, after which the genus is named, although an indeterminate species (""cf. ",0
8969,"Albertosaurus sp."") has been discovered in the Corral de Enmedio and Packard Formations in Mexico.  ",1
8970,"Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second species. ",0
8971,"As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. ",0
8972,It may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. ,0
8973,"While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing 9 to 10 m (30 to 33 ft) and possibly weighing 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons) or less. ",0
8974,"Since the first discovery in 1884, fossils of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. ",0
8975,"The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology, which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs. ",0
8976,Albertosaurus was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of Tyrannosaurus rex. :265 ,1
8977,"Alberta, the Canadian province established the same year, in which the first remains were found. ",0
8978,"The generic name also incorporates the Greek term ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï/sauros (""lizard""), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. ",0
8979,"The type species is Albertosaurus sarcophagus; the specific name is derived from Ancient Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎoÎ¿ÏÎ±ÌÎ3Î¿Ï (sarkophagos) meaning ""flesh-eating"" and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words ÏÎ±ÏÎ3⁄4/sarx (""flesh"") and ÏÎ±Î3ÎμÎ1Î1⁄2/phagein (""to eat"").  More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science.   ",1
8980,"The type specimen is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an outcrop of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation alongside the Red Deer River, in Alberta. ",0
8981,"This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the Geological Survey of Canada, led by the famous geologist Joseph Burr Tyrrell. ",0
8982,Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. ,0
8983,"In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby.  ",1
8984,"The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species Laelaps incrassatus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892,  although the name Laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to Dryptosaurus in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. ",1
8985,Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. ,0
8986,"However, Lawrence Lambe used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of Laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904,   a combination first coined by Oliver Perry Hay in 1902.  ",1
8987,"Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that D. incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. ",0
8988,"The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis, type species of Dryptosaurus, so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in 1905. ",0
8989,"He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before.  ",1
8990,Both specimens (the holotype CMN 5600 and the paratype CMN 5601) are stored in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. ,0
8991,"By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, Albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium, a ""dubious name"" that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. ",0
8992,"However, in 2010, Thomas Carr established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone, proving that Albertosaurus was a valid taxon.  ",1
8993,"On 11 August 1910, American paleontologist Barnum Brown discovered the remains of a large group of Albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the Red Deer River. ",0
8994,"Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed. ",0
8995,"Among the bones deposited in the American Museum of Natural History collections in New York City are seven sets of right metatarsals, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. ",0
8996,This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. ,0
8997,"Palaeontologist Philip J. Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park.  ",1
8998,"Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of 13 more individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over 10 metres (33 feet) in length. ",0
8999,"None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums.   ",1
9000,"Excavations continued until 2008, when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at 12, on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at 26 if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny. ",0
9001,"A total of 1,128 Albertosaurus bones had been secured, the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.  ",1
9002,"In 1911, Barnum Brown, during the second year of American Museum of Natural History operations in Alberta, uncovered a fragmentary partial Albertosaurus skull at the Red Deer River near Tolman Bridge, specimen AMNH 5222.[14 ",0
9003,"William Parks described a new species in 1928, Albertosaurus arctunguis, based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by Gus Lindblad and Ralph Hornell near the Red Deer River in 1923,  but this species has been considered identical to A. sarcophagus since 1970.  Parks' specimen (ROM 807) is housed in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. ",1
9004,"Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils were found at all; but, since the seventies, there has been a steady increase in the known material. ",0
9005,"Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; ",0
9006,"RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. ",0
9007,"However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds.  ",1
9008,"Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Missouri, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.   ",1
9009,"Two specimens from (""cf Albertosaurus "".sp"") have been found in Mexico (Packard Formation and Corral de Enmedio Formation).  ",1
9010,"In 1913, paleontologist Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. ",0
9011,Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914.  Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. ,1
9012,"Finding, largely due to a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. ",0
9013,This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.  ,1
9014,"In 2003, Philip J. Currie, benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. ",0
9015,"The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. ",0
9016,"Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. ",0
9017,"In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully.  ",1
9018,"Apart from A. sarcophagus, A. arctunguis and A. libratus, several other species of Albertosaurus have been named. ",0
9019,"All of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as nomina dubia, and are not assigned to Albertosaurus. ",0
9020,"In 1930, Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin named Albertosaurus pericolosus based on a tooth from China, that probably belonged to Tarbosaurus.  ",1
9021,"In 1932, Friedrich von Huene renamed Dryptosaurus incrassatus, not considered a nomen dubium by him, to Albertosaurus incrassatus.  ",1
9022,"Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus, in 1970, Russell also renamed Gorgosaurus sternbergi (Matthew & Brown 1922) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis (Gilmore 1946) into Albertosaurus lancensis.  ",1
9023,"The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus, the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus. ",0
9024,"In 1988, Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana.  ",1
9025,"It was renamed Dinotyrannus in 1995,  but is now thought to represent a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.  ",1
9026,"Also in 1988, Paul renamed Alectrosaurus olseni (Gilmore 1933) into Albertosaurus olseni;  this has found no general acceptance. ",1
9027,"In 1989, Gorgosaurus novojilovi (Maleev 1955) was renamed by Bryn Mader and Robert Bradley as Albertosaurus novojilovi;  today this is seen as a synonym of Tarbosaurus. ",1
9028,"On two occasions, species based on valid Albertosaurus material were reassigned to a different genus: in 1922 William Diller Matthew renamed A. sarcophagus into Deinodon sarcophagus  and in 1939 German paleontologist Oskar Kuhn renamed A. arctunguis into Deinodon arctunguis.  Albertosaurus was larger than most tyrannosaurids, but smaller than Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. ",1
9029,"Typical Albertosaurus adults measured up to 9 m (30 ft) long,   while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over 10 metres (33 feet ",1
9030,") long.  Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1.3 tonnes and 2.5 tonnes (2.8 tons).    ",1
9031,In 2016 Molina-PeÌrez and Larramendi estimated the (CMN 5600) specimen at 9.7 meters (32 ft) and 4 tonnes (4.4 short tons).  ,1
9032,"Typically for a theropod, Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail. ",0
9033,"However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. ",0
9034,"The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the hallux, was short and did not reach the ground. ",0
9035,] Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14â21 km/hour (8â13 mi/hour).  ,1
9036,"At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.  ",1
9037,"Two skin impressions from Albertosaurus are known, both showing scales.  One patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long, unknown bone, indicating that the patch is from the belly. ",1
9038,The scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape. ,0
9039,"Also preserved are two larger feature scales, placed 4.5 cm apart from each other.  ",1
9040,Another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body. ,0
9041,"The massive skull of Albertosaurus, which was perched on a short, S-shaped neck, was about 1 metre (3.3 feet) long in the largest adults.  ",1
9042,Wide openings in the skull (fenestrae) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. ,0
9043,"Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth; Gorgosaurus had more at 62. ",0
9044,"Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. ",0
9045,"The premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in cross section.  ",1
9046,"Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary (cheek) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. ",0
9047,"The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons.  ",1
9048,Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.  ,1
9049,"William Abler observed in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla.  Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth.  ",1
9050,"However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain.  ",1
9051,The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. ,0
9052,"Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, ""impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity"" to wood they work.  ",1
9053,"The use of a drill to create an ""ampulla"" of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces.  ",1
9054,"Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called ""kerfs"" and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions.  ",1
9055,"Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like phytosaurs and Dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.[36 ",0
9056,"] Albertosaurus is a member of the theropod family Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. ",0
9057,Its closest relative is the slightly older Gorgosaurus libratus (sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus; see below).  ,1
9058,These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist.  ,1
9059,"Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004,  but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae,  in agreement with other authors.  ",1
9060,"The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. ",0
9061,"Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).   ",1
9062,Below is the cladogram of the Tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen et al. in 2013.  Gorgosaurus libratus Albertosaurus sarcophagus ,1
9063,Most age categories of Albertosaurus are represented in the fossil record. ,0
9064,"Using bone histology, the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. ",0
9065,"The youngest known Albertosaurus is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110 lb) and measured slightly more than 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length. ",0
9066,"The 10 metres (33 feet) specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. ",0
9067,"When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an S-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. ",0
9068,"The growth rate during this phase was 122 kilograms (269 pounds) per year, based on an adult 1.3 tonnes. ",0
9069,"Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. ",0
9070,"Tyrannosaurids similar in size to Albertosaurus had similar growth rates, although the much larger Tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate (601 kilograms1,325 pounds] per year) at its peak.  ",1
9071,"The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives.   Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small  and large  dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants.  ",1
9072,"This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.   ",1
9073,"During growth, through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.  Most known Albertosaurus individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death. ",1
9074,"Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field.  ",1
9075,"Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. ",0
9076,"It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.  ",1
9077,"A hypothesis of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. ",0
9078,"After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. ",0
9079,This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. ,0
9080,"Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. ",0
9081,"This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. ",0
9082,The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. ,0
9083,Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. ,0
9084,"High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. ",0
9085,"The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.    ",1
9086,"The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 Albertosaurus, the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the Allosaurus assemblage at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. ",0
9087,"The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.  ",1
9088,"The near-absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. ",0
9089,"Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.    There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs, including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs.  ",1
9090,"However, only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site. ",0
9091,"Small theropods like Deinonychus  and Coelophysis  have been found in aggregations, as have larger predators like Allosaurus and Mapusaurus.  ",1
9092,There is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well. ,0
9093,"Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside ""Sue"", the Tyrannosaurus mounted in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and a bonebed in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana contains at least three specimens of Daspletosaurus, preserved alongside several hadrosaurs.  ",1
9094,"These findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in Albertosaurus, although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations.  ",1
9095,"Others have speculated that instead of social groups, at least some of these finds represent Komodo dragon-like mobbing of carcasses, where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and cannibalized.  ",1
9096,"The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. ",0
9097,"Younger Albertosaurus were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. ",0
9098,"Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower.  ",1
9099,"Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult Albertosaurus in mass.  ",1
9100,"A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands.  ",1
9101,"However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. ",0
9102,"In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.  ",1
9103,"In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds.  ",1
9104,"They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.  ",1
9105,"In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. ",0
9106,They found that only one of the 319 Albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did. ,0
9107,"The scientists found that stress fractures were ""significantly"" less common in Albertosaurus than in the carnosaur Allosaurus.  ROM 807, the holotype of A. arctunguis (now referred to A. sarcophagus), had a 2.5 by 3.5 cm (0.98 by 1.38 in) deep hole in the iliac blade, although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological. ",1
9108,The specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal. ,0
9109,"In 1970, two of the five Albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them.  ",1
9110,"In 2010, the health of the Dry Island Albertosaurus assembly was reported upon. ",0
9111,"On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. ",0
9112,Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. ,0
9113,One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. ,0
9114,The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.  Most fossils of Albertosaurus sarcophagus are known from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. ,1
9115,"These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). ",0
9116,"Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing a section of the Western Interior Seaway. ",0
9117,"The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. ",0
9118,"It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. ",0
9119,"Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. ",0
9120,"Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.  ",1
9121,"The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. ",0
9122,"Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna. ",0
9123,"The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. ",0
9124,"Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus. ",0
9125,"Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. ",0
9126,"Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and caenagnathids.   Intermingled with the Albertosaurus remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod Albertonykus were found.  Adult Albertosaurus were the apex predators in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.[57      Allosaurus ",1
9127,(/ËÃ¦lÉËsÉËrÉs/  ) is a genus of large carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago during the late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to late Tithonian ). ,1
9128,"The name ""Allosaurus"" means ""different lizard"" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its discovery). ",0
9129,"It is derived from the Greek Î±ÌÌÎ»Î»Î¿Ï (allos) (""different, other"") and ÏÎ±ÏÍÏÎ¿Ï (sauros) (""lizard / generic reptile""). ",0
9130,The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. ,0
9131,"As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. ",0
9132,"Its skull was light, robust and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth. ",0
9133,"It averaged 10 meters (33 ft) in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over 12 m (39 ft). ",0
9134,"Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. ",0
9135,"It is classified as an allosaurid, a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur. ",0
9136,"The genus has a complicated taxonomy, and includes three valid species, the best known of which is A. fragilis. ",0
9137,"The bulk of Allosaurus remains have come from North America's Morrison Formation, with material also known from Portugal. ",0
9138,"It was known for over half of the 20th century as Antrodemus, but a study of the copious remains from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry brought the name ""Allosaurus"" back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs. ",0
9139,"As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus was at the top of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps other predators. ",0
9140,"Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. ",0
9141,"Allosaurus was a typical large theropod, having a massive skull on a short neck, a long, slightly sloping tail and reduced forelimbs. ",0
9142,"Allosaurus fragilis, the best-known species, had an average length of 8.5 m (28 ft),  with the largest definitive Allosaurus specimen (AMNH 680) estimated at 9.7 meters (32 feet) long,  and an estimated weight of 2.3 metric tons (2.5 short tons).  ",1
9143,"In his 1976 monograph on Allosaurus, James H. Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of 12 to 13 m (39 to 43 ft).  ",1
9144,"As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds), 1,000 to 4,000 kg (2,200 to 8,800 lb), and 1,010 kilograms (2,230 pounds) for modal adult weight (not maximum).  ",1
9145,"John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) is reasonable for large adults of A. fragilis, but that 700 kg (1,500 lb) is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized thigh bones he has measured.  Using the subadult specimen nicknamed ""Big Al"", since assigned to the species ",1
9146,"Allosaurus jimmadseni,  researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb) for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) to approximately 2,000 kilograms (4,400 lb).  Several gigantic specimens have been attributed to Allosaurus, but may in fact belong to other genera. ",1
9147,"The closely related genus Saurophaganax (OMNH 1708) reached perhaps 10.9 m (36 ft) in length,  and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus Allosaurus as Allosaurus maximus, though recent studies support it as a separate genus.  ",1
9148,"Another potential specimen of Allosaurus, once assigned to the genus Epanterias (AMNH 5767), may have measured 12.1 meters (40 feet) in length.  ",1
